# Running the `compare_plsql_packagesGemini.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up the necessary environment and run the `compare_plsql_packagesGemini.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.  It covers installation of Python 3.13.0, JupyterLab, virtual environment creation, and dependency installation.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Turnkey VPN for accessing the db away from office.
*   Basic familiarity with command-line interfaces (CMD, PowerShell,Git Bash, or Terminal).

**1. Installing Python 3.13.0**

   Since Python 3.13.0 is a newer version, ensure you download it from the official Python website.

   *   **Download:** Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130/) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows or Linux).  **Important:** Select the *correct installer for your operating system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit)*.

   *   **Windows Installation:**

        1.  Run the downloaded installer (`.exe` file).
        2.  **Crucially**, check the box that says "Add Python 3.13 to PATH" during the installation process. This is essential for using Python from the command line. If you forget to do this, see the instructions below on adding Python to your PATH manually.
        3.  Click "Install Now" (or customize the installation if desired, ensuring you note the installation directory).

   *   **Linux Installation:**

        1.  The installation process varies depending on your Linux distribution. Generally, you can use a package manager or build from source.  The link above leads to a download of the source version, which can be used for compiling.
        2.  **Using a Package Manager (Recommended):** First check if your Linux distribution offers Python 3.13 in its package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu systems, you might use `apt`, but packages might not be available yet. Check first with `apt search python3.13` to see if it is available. If it is, install with `sudo apt install python3.13`.
        3.  **Building from Source (If Package Not Available):** This is a more advanced approach.
            *   Download the "Gzipped source tarball" from the Python 3.13.0 download page.
            *   Extract the tarball: `tar -xf Python-3.13.0.tgz`
            *   Navigate into the extracted directory: `cd Python-3.13.0`
            *   Configure the build: `./configure --enable-optimizations` (The `--enable-optimizations` flag improves performance)
            *   Build the code: `make -j $(nproc)` (The `-j $(nproc)` flag uses all available cores for faster compilation)
            *   Install Python: `sudo make install` (This might require `sudo make altinstall` to avoid overwriting the system Python)
        4.  **Important (Linux):**  After installation, you might need to update your `alternatives` to use Python 3.13 as the default, or use `python3.13` explicitly when creating virtual environments.

   *   **Verifying Installation:**

        1.  Open a new command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Linux).
        2.  Type `python3.13 --version` or `python --version` (if you have set the default to python 3.13).  You should see `Python 3.13.0` printed to the console.  If you get an error, ensure Python's installation directory is in your system's PATH environment variable (see below).

   *   **Adding Python to PATH Manually (Windows):**

        1.  Search for "Environment Variables" in the Windows search bar.
        2.  Click "Edit the system environment variables".
        3.  Click "Environment Variables..."
        4.  In the "System variables" section, find the "Path" variable and click "Edit...".
        5.  Click "New" and add the following paths (adjust if you customized the installation directory):
            *   `C:\Users\{Your Username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313` (This is just an example. The real path depends on your installation)
            *   `C:\Users\{Your Username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Scripts`

        6.  Click "OK" on all windows to save the changes.  **Important:** Close and reopen your command prompt for the changes to take effect.

**2. Installing JupyterLab**

   JupyterLab will be installed within the virtual environment in a later step.  This ensures that your JupyterLab installation is isolated from other Python projects.

**3. Creating and Activating a Virtual Environment**

   Virtual environments provide isolated spaces for Python projects, preventing dependency conflicts.

   *   **Create the Virtual Environment:**

        1.  Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Linux).
        2.  Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project (e.g., `cd C:\Projects\plsql_compare` or `cd ~/projects/plsql_compare`).
        3.  Create the virtual environment:  `python3.13 -m venv venv` (This creates a directory named `venv` containing the virtual environment files).  Replace `venv` with a name you prefer, if desired.  Using `python3.13` ensures the virtual environment uses the correct Python version.

   *   **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

        *   **Windows:** `venv\Scripts\activate` if using Git bash on windos, `source venv/Scripts/activate`
        *   **Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`

        After activation, your command prompt/terminal will be prefixed with `(venv)` (or the name you chose for your environment), indicating that the virtual environment is active.

**4. Installing JupyterLab within the Virtual Environment**

   With the virtual environment activated, install JupyterLab using `pip`.

   *   `pip install jupyterlab`

   This command installs JupyterLab and its dependencies within the isolated environment.

**5. Running JupyterLab**

   Start JupyterLab from the command line within the activated virtual environment.

   *   `jupyter lab`

   This command will launch JupyterLab in your default web browser.  It will also print a URL to the console, which you can copy and paste into your browser if it doesn't open automatically.

**6. Creating a Kernel for the Virtual Environment**

   To use your virtual environment within JupyterLab, you need to create a kernel that points to the environment's Python interpreter.

   *   **Install `ipykernel`:**

        ```bash
        pip install ipykernel
        ```

   *   **Create the Kernel:**

        ```bash
        python -m ipykernel install --user --name=plsql_compare_env --display-name="Python 3.13 (plsql_compare_env)"
        ```

        *   `--name`:  A unique name for the kernel (e.g., `plsql_compare_env`).
        *   `--display-name`: The name that will appear in the JupyterLab kernel selection menu (e.g., "Python 3.13 (plsql_compare_env)"). This is what you will select when opening your notebook.

**7. Opening and Running the Notebook**

   1.  In JupyterLab, navigate to the location of the `compare_plsql_packagesGemini.ipynb` file and open it.
   2.  In the JupyterLab menu, go to "Kernel" -> "Change Kernel..."
   3.  Select the kernel you created in the previous step (e.g., "Python 3.13 (plsql_compare_env)").
   4.  **Install Dependencies:** Open the first cell of the notebook and run it. This cell likely contains `pip install` commands to install the required Python packages.  **To run a cell, select it and press Shift + Enter.**  Repeat this process for any other cells containing installation commands.

   If the notebook contains cells with install commands, it's crucial to run these first.  You might encounter errors if dependencies are missing.
   * **Restart Kernel (if needed):** After installing the dependencies it is a good practice to restart the kernel: *Kernel > Restart Kernel*

**8. Troubleshooting**

*   **`jupyter` command not found:** Ensure JupyterLab is installed within the activated virtual environment.  Double-check that the virtual environment is activated.
*   **Kernel not found:** Double-check that you created the kernel correctly and that the `display-name` is what you expect.
*   **Import errors:** If you get "ModuleNotFoundError" or similar import errors, it means the required Python packages are not installed in your virtual environment.  Run the necessary `pip install` commands (as found in the notebook or its documentation).
*   **Permissions issues (Linux):** If you encounter permission errors, try running the commands with `sudo` or adjusting file permissions as needed.
*   **Error installing packages with pip:** Make sure you have the latest version of pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Keep your virtual environment active:** When working on this project, always ensure your virtual environment is active before running JupyterLab or any Python scripts.
*   **Documentation:** Consult the `compare_plsql_packagesGemini.ipynb` notebook itself for any specific instructions or requirements related to the code.
*   **Upgrading Packages:** Regularly update your packages within the virtual environment using `pip install --upgrade <package_name>`.
*   **Deactivating the Virtual Environment:** When you are finished working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by typing `deactivate` in the command prompt/terminal.

This comprehensive guide should enable you to successfully set up and run the `compare_plsql_packagesGemini.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.  Remember to adapt the paths and names to match your specific setup. Good luck!
