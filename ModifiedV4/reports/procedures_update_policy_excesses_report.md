# PL/SQL Procedure `update_policy_excesses` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `update_policy_excesses` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes:

### Reordering of Conditional Logic:

- **HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic (`IF v_action = 'A' THEN ... ELSIF v_action = 'E' THEN ... ELSIF v_action = 'D' THEN ... END IF;`) was less structured, potentially impacting readability and maintainability.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The conditional logic is now more clearly structured with improved indentation and formatting, enhancing readability and maintainability.  The `IF-ELSIF-ELSE` structure is more explicit and easier to follow.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses:

- **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed from the `WHERE` clauses. However, the `WHERE` clauses in the `SELECT` and `UPDATE` statements have been formatted for better readability.  The conditions themselves remain functionally equivalent.

### Exception Handling Adjustments:

- **HERITAGE Version:** Exception handling was present but could be improved in terms of consistency and clarity. Error messages were somewhat generic.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** Exception handling remains largely the same, but the code formatting is improved, making it easier to understand the error handling flow.  The error messages are slightly more informative, though still could benefit from more specific details.

### Formatting and Indentation:

- The NEW_GEMINIA version shows significant improvements in formatting and indentation.  The code is much more readable and easier to follow due to consistent use of whitespace and line breaks.  The `INSERT` statement is now broken into multiple lines for better readability.


## Implications of the Changes:

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination:

- **Priority Shift:** There is no change to the core logic of fee determination.  The procedure does not directly calculate fees; it manages the data related to policy excesses.

- **Potential Outcome Difference:** The changes are primarily cosmetic and organizational.  The functional behavior of the procedure should remain unchanged, provided the underlying database schema and data remain consistent.

### Business Rule Alignment:

The changes do not appear to alter any core business rules. The procedure's functionality—adding, editing, or deleting policy excesses—remains the same.

### Impact on Clients:

The changes should be transparent to clients.  The underlying business logic and data processing remain unchanged.


## Recommendations for Merging:

### Review Business Requirements:

- **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the formatting and structural changes in the NEW_GEMINIA version accurately reflect the intended behavior.  The functional logic should be carefully reviewed to ensure no unintended consequences.

### Consult Stakeholders:

Discuss the changes with relevant stakeholders (developers, business analysts, testers) to ensure everyone understands and agrees with the modifications.

### Test Thoroughly:

- **Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases covering all scenarios (add, edit, delete) with various data inputs, including edge cases and boundary conditions.  Pay close attention to error handling paths.

- **Validate Outcomes:**  Compare the results of the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions for identical inputs to ensure functional equivalence.

### Merge Strategy:

- **Conditional Merge:** A direct merge is recommended, given the changes are primarily formatting and structural improvements.  A thorough code review is crucial before merging.

- **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  The changes should not affect backward compatibility, as the core functionality remains unchanged.

### Update Documentation:

Update the procedure's documentation to reflect the changes made, particularly highlighting the improved formatting and structure.

### Code Quality Improvements:

- **Consistent Exception Handling:** While the exception handling is improved, consider adding more specific error messages that include relevant data (e.g., the specific `pspr_code` causing the error).

- **Clean Up Code:**  Ensure consistent naming conventions and remove any unnecessary comments or code.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis:

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and stakeholder review.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:**  Revert the changes and investigate why the differences exist.

- **If Uncertain:** Conduct further investigation and testing to clarify the impact of the changes before merging.


## Additional Considerations:

### Database Integrity:

The changes should not impact database integrity, provided the underlying database schema remains unchanged.

### Performance Impact:

The formatting and structural changes are unlikely to have a significant impact on performance.

### Error Messages:

Improve the error messages to provide more specific information to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.


## Conclusion:

The changes in the `update_policy_excesses` procedure are primarily focused on improving code readability, maintainability, and structure.  The core functionality remains unchanged.  A careful merge process, including thorough testing and stakeholder review, is recommended to ensure a smooth transition and maintain the integrity of the system.  The improved formatting and structure will benefit future development and maintenance efforts.
