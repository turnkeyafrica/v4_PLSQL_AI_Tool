# PL/SQL Procedure `update_mandatory_sections` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `update_mandatory_sections` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.


## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

**HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version uses a nested `IF-ELSE` structure.  The primary logic (processing `mandatory_sections`) executes unless `v_cashback_only` is 'Y'.  Cashback section processing only happens if `v_cashback_only` is 'Y' AND cashback conditions are met.  This implies a priority on mandatory sections unless explicitly specified otherwise.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version uses a simpler `IF-ELSE` structure. The primary logic (processing `mandatory_sections`) executes if `v_cashback_only` is 'N'.  Cashback section processing happens only if `v_cashback_only` is 'Y' AND cashback conditions are met.  The structure is more readable and less nested.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

**Removal and Addition of Conditions:** The `mandatory_sections` cursor in the NEW_GEMINIA version now includes `scvts_order` and `scvts_calc_group` in the SELECT statement.  This suggests an addition of order and calculation group information for the mandatory sections.  No conditions were removed from the `WHERE` clause of either cursor.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

**HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version has minimal exception handling.  It only handles `NO_DATA_FOUND` exception when retrieving `v_row`.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version includes a `WHEN OTHERS` exception handler for the `GIN_INSURED_PROPERTY_UNDS` select statement, which gracefully handles potential errors during data retrieval.  The `NO_DATA_FOUND` exception handler for `v_row` remains.  This improvement enhances robustness.

### Formatting and Indentation

The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, making the code more readable and maintainable.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

**Priority Shift:**

**HERITAGE:**  Mandatory sections are processed first, unless `v_cashback_only` is 'Y', in which case cashback sections are prioritized if conditions are met.

**NEW_GEMINIA:**  The logic remains largely the same, but the code structure is improved.  The priority of processing mandatory sections versus cashback sections based on `v_cashback_only` remains consistent.

**Potential Outcome Difference:** The core logic regarding the order of processing mandatory and cashback sections remains unchanged.  However, the addition of `scvts_order` and `scvts_calc_group` to the `mandatory_sections` cursor *could* lead to different results if these fields impact the `gin_rsk_limits_stp` procedure's behavior.

### Business Rule Alignment

The changes might reflect a refinement in the business rules related to section processing order and inclusion of calculation groups.  The addition of `scvts_order` and `scvts_calc_group` suggests a more structured approach to processing sections.

### Impact on Clients

The changes are likely transparent to clients unless the addition of `scvts_order` and `scvts_calc_group` to `gin_rsk_limits_stp` alters the calculated fees or section processing order.  Thorough testing is crucial to ensure no unintended consequences.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

**Confirm Intent:** Verify if the addition of `scvts_order` and `scvts_calc_group` accurately reflects the intended business requirements.  Clarify if this change is expected to alter the fee calculation or section processing order.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with relevant stakeholders (business analysts, testers, etc.) to ensure alignment with business goals and to understand the implications of the modifications.

### Test Thoroughly

**Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions, to validate the functionality of the updated procedure.  Pay close attention to scenarios where `v_cashback_only` is 'Y' and 'N', and where `scvts_order` and `scvts_calc_group` influence the outcome.

**Validate Outcomes:** Compare the results of the NEW_GEMINIA version with the HERITAGE version for a wide range of inputs to identify any discrepancies.

### Merge Strategy

**Conditional Merge:**  A conditional merge approach is recommended.  Carefully review the changes line by line, ensuring that the improved formatting and exception handling are incorporated.  The core logic changes should be thoroughly tested before merging.

**Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  If possible, maintain backward compatibility by adding a parameter to control the behavior (e.g., a flag indicating whether to use the new ordering logic).  This allows for a phased rollout and minimizes disruption.

### Update Documentation

Update the procedure's documentation to reflect the changes made, including the addition of the `v_module` parameter and the new fields in the `mandatory_sections` cursor.

### Code Quality Improvements

**Consistent Exception Handling:**  Implement consistent exception handling throughout the procedure, handling all potential errors gracefully.

**Clean Up Code:**  Remove any commented-out code or unnecessary elements to improve code readability and maintainability.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

**If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and documentation updates.

**If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes and investigate the reasons for the discrepancy between the intended and implemented functionality.

**If Uncertain:** Conduct further investigation and consultation with stakeholders before making a decision on merging.


## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

Ensure that the changes do not compromise database integrity.  Thorough testing is crucial to prevent data corruption or inconsistencies.

### Performance Impact

Assess the performance impact of the changes, especially if the `gin_rsk_limits_stp` procedure is computationally intensive.  Profiling and performance testing are recommended.

### Error Messages

Review and improve the error messages to provide more informative and user-friendly feedback in case of errors.


## Conclusion

The changes in `update_mandatory_sections` primarily involve improved code structure, enhanced exception handling, and the addition of fields related to section order and calculation groups. While the core logic remains largely consistent, the addition of `scvts_order` and `scvts_calc_group` necessitates thorough testing to ensure the changes align with business requirements and do not introduce unintended consequences.  A phased rollout with backward compatibility is recommended to minimize risk.
