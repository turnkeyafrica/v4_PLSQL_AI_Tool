# PL/SQL Procedure `update_declarations` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `update_declarations` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

- **HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic (`IF NVL (v_cnt, 0) > 1 THEN ... END IF;`) checking for duplicated risks or sections was placed after the database update statement.  This means the update would occur even if duplicates were detected.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The conditional logic is now placed *before* the `UPDATE` statement. This ensures that the update only proceeds if no duplicates are found.  This is a significant improvement in logic flow.


### Modification of WHERE Clauses

- **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed. The `WHERE` clauses in both the cursor and the `UPDATE` statement have been slightly reformatted for improved readability, but the core logic remains the same.  The `DECODE` function remains, handling cases where `v_ipu_code` is null or a specific value.


### Exception Handling Adjustments

- **HERITAGE Version:** The `EXCEPTION` block handled `WHEN OTHERS` but only raised a generic error message: 'Error verifying underwriting year..'.  This lacked specificity.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The `EXCEPTION` block remains, but the error message is still generic ('Error verifying underwriting year..').  However, the improved placement of the conditional logic to check for duplicates adds a more specific error message ('Risk or sections duplicated ..').  The exception handling could be improved further by providing more context-specific error messages.


### Formatting and Indentation

- The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, making the code more readable and maintainable.  Parameter lists are broken across multiple lines for better readability.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

- **Priority Shift:**
    - **HERITAGE:** The update to `gin_policy_insured_limits` occurred regardless of duplicate risk detection.
    - **NEW_GEMINIA:** The update is now conditional, preventing updates if duplicates are found.

- **Potential Outcome Difference:** The HERITAGE version could have resulted in incorrect data updates in cases of duplicate risks or sections. The NEW_GEMINIA version corrects this, ensuring data integrity.


### Business Rule Alignment

The NEW_GEMINIA version better aligns with the expected business rule of preventing updates when duplicate risks or sections are detected. The HERITAGE version had a flaw in its implementation of this rule.


### Impact on Clients

The change directly impacts data integrity. The HERITAGE version could have led to incorrect policy data, potentially affecting client premiums or coverage. The NEW_GEMINIA version mitigates this risk.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

- **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the change in conditional logic accurately reflects the intended business rules for handling duplicate risks and sections.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with relevant stakeholders (business analysts, testers, and users) to ensure the updated logic meets their expectations.

### Test Thoroughly

- **Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases to cover various scenarios, including cases with and without duplicate risks, and different values for `v_ipu_code`.
- **Validate Outcomes:** Verify that the updated procedure correctly handles all scenarios and produces the expected results.

### Merge Strategy

- **Conditional Merge:** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version, prioritizing the corrected conditional logic and improved formatting.

- **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  If backward compatibility is critical, consider adding a version flag or creating a separate procedure to handle legacy data.

### Update Documentation

Update the procedure's documentation to reflect the changes made and their implications.

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Consistent Exception Handling:**  Improve exception handling by providing more specific error messages for different error conditions.  Consider using custom exception types.
- **Clean Up Code:**  Maintain consistent formatting and indentation throughout the codebase.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and stakeholder review.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes and investigate why the business requirements were not correctly implemented in the HERITAGE version.

- **If Uncertain:** Conduct further analysis and testing to clarify the impact of the changes before making a decision.


## Additional Considerations

- **Database Integrity:** The change significantly improves database integrity by preventing updates in cases of duplicate data.

- **Performance Impact:** The addition of the conditional check before the update might slightly impact performance, but this is likely negligible.  Profiling should be done to confirm.

- **Error Messages:** The error messages could be improved to provide more context and helpful information for debugging.


## Conclusion

The changes in the `update_declarations` procedure represent a significant improvement in terms of data integrity and code quality. The corrected conditional logic prevents potential data corruption, aligning the procedure more closely with business requirements.  Thorough testing and stakeholder consultation are crucial before merging the NEW_GEMINIA version.  Addressing the generic nature of the exception handling would further enhance the procedure's robustness.
