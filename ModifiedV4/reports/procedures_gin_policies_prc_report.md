# PL/SQL Procedure `gin_policies_prc` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `gin_policies_prc` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

**HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic, particularly around policy transaction types (`pol_trans_type`), appears less structured and potentially harder to follow.  The order of checks might not be optimized for efficiency or readability.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The code shows improved structuring of conditional logic.  Blocks of code related to specific transaction types are better organized, enhancing readability and maintainability.  The addition of comments also improves understanding.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

**Removal and Addition of Conditions:**  Significant changes were made to the `WHERE` clauses in several `SELECT` statements, primarily within the validation checks for policy cover dates.  The HERITAGE version contained hardcoded policy numbers in some `WHERE` clauses, which have been removed in the NEW_GEMINIA version.  The NEW_GEMINIA version also refines the conditions to exclude cancelled (`CN`) policies more consistently, improving data accuracy.  The addition of a subquery to exclude previous batches with cancelled statuses enhances the logic for handling policy renewals and reinstates.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

**HERITAGE Version:** Exception handling is present but might lack consistency.  Some error messages are less informative.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:**  Exception handling is more robust and informative. Error messages are more descriptive, providing better context for debugging.  The addition of specific error messages for different scenarios improves the user experience.

### Formatting and Indentation

The NEW_GEMINIA version demonstrates improved formatting and indentation, making the code significantly more readable and easier to understand.  The HERITAGE version suffers from inconsistent formatting.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

**Priority Shift:** The HERITAGE version's fee determination logic might have implicit priorities that are not clearly defined.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The introduction of `v_comm_applicable` and the logic around determining commission applicability for introducers in direct business introduces a more explicit and potentially different priority in calculating commissions.  This change clarifies the conditions under which commissions are applied, especially for introducers.

**Potential Outcome Difference:** The changes in fee calculation logic could lead to different commission amounts being calculated for certain policies, particularly those involving introducers in direct business.  This requires careful testing to ensure the new logic aligns with business requirements.

### Business Rule Alignment

The NEW_GEMINIA version appears to better align with business rules regarding policy cover date validation and commission calculation for introducers.  The HERITAGE version might contain inconsistencies or ambiguities in these areas.

### Impact on Clients

The changes in policy processing could affect clients' policy details, premiums, and commission calculations.  Thorough testing is crucial to ensure that these changes do not negatively impact clients.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

**Confirm Intent:**  Carefully review the business requirements to confirm the intent behind the changes in the NEW_GEMINIA version, particularly regarding fee calculation and policy cover date validation.

### Consult Stakeholders

Consult with business stakeholders, including underwriters and client-facing teams, to validate the changes and ensure they meet business needs.

### Test Thoroughly

**Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases covering all policy transaction types (`NB`, `RN`, `ME`, `EX`, `SP`, etc.) and scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions.  Pay close attention to commission calculations and cover date validations.

**Validate Outcomes:**  Validate that the changes in the NEW_GEMINIA version produce the expected results and do not introduce unintended consequences.  Compare the results with the HERITAGE version for discrepancies.

### Merge Strategy

**Conditional Merge:**  A conditional merge strategy is recommended.  Carefully review each change and assess its impact before merging.  Consider using a version control system to track changes and facilitate rollback if needed.

**Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  If possible, maintain backward compatibility by adding a parameter or configuration option to allow switching between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA logic during a transition period.

### Update Documentation

Update the package and procedure documentation to reflect the changes made in the NEW_GEMINIA version.  Include details about the new logic, exception handling, and potential impact on clients.

### Code Quality Improvements

**Consistent Exception Handling:**  Ensure consistent exception handling throughout the procedure.  Use informative error messages and handle exceptions appropriately.

**Clean Up Code:**  Clean up any remaining inconsistencies in formatting and indentation.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

**If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and stakeholder validation.

**If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes in the NEW_GEMINIA version and address the issues in the HERITAGE version through refactoring and improved code quality.

**If Uncertain:** Conduct further investigation and analysis to clarify the intent and impact of the changes before making a decision.


## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

Verify that the changes do not compromise database integrity.  Pay close attention to data validation and constraint checks.

### Performance Impact

Assess the potential performance impact of the changes.  The addition of new conditions and logic might affect query performance.  Consider optimizing the code for efficiency.

### Error Messages

Ensure that error messages are clear, informative, and user-friendly.  Provide sufficient context to help users understand and resolve errors.


## Conclusion

The changes in the NEW_GEMINIA version of `gin_policies_prc` represent a significant improvement in code quality, readability, and potentially business rule alignment. However, the changes to fee calculation and validation logic necessitate thorough testing and stakeholder consultation to ensure correctness and avoid unintended consequences.  A phased rollout with a backward compatibility mechanism is highly recommended to minimize disruption.  A robust testing strategy is critical before deploying the updated procedure to production.
