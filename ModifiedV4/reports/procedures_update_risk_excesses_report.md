# PL/SQL Procedure `update_risk_excesses` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `update_risk_excesses` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

- **HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic (`IF v_action = 'A' THEN ... ELSIF v_action = 'E' THEN ... ELSIF v_action = 'D' THEN ... END IF;`) was implicitly nested within the policy authorization check (`IF v_status = 'A' AND NVL (v_pol_loaded, 'N') = 'N' THEN ... END IF;`).  This means the authorization check was performed only once, before all actions.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The policy authorization check (`IF v_status = 'A' AND NVL (v_pol_loaded, 'N') = 'N' THEN ... END IF;`) now precedes each action (`IF v_action = 'A' THEN ... ELSIF v_action = 'E' THEN ... ELSIF v_action = 'D' THEN ... END IF;`). This means the authorization is checked for each action individually.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

- **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** The `WHERE` clause in the `SELECT` statement retrieving peril/excess data has been slightly restructured for better readability and clarity.  The `WHERE` clause in the `UPDATE` statement now uses `NVL` to handle potential null values gracefully, preventing unexpected behavior.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

- **HERITAGE Version:** Exception handling was present but lacked consistency in error message formatting and detail.  The error messages were somewhat generic.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** Exception handling is improved with more descriptive and informative error messages, providing better debugging capabilities.  The error messages now include specific context (e.g., subclass code).  The `WHEN OTHERS` exception is more robust.

### Formatting and Indentation

- The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, enhancing readability and maintainability.  The `INSERT` statement is now formatted across multiple lines for better readability.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

- **Priority Shift:**  The HERITAGE version checked policy authorization only once. The NEW_GEMINIA version checks it for each action (add, edit, delete).

- **Potential Outcome Difference:** The change in authorization check placement could lead to different outcomes if a policy's authorization status changes between actions.  In the HERITAGE version, if authorization changed after the initial check, subsequent actions might proceed even if unauthorized.  The NEW_GEMINIA version prevents this.

### Business Rule Alignment

The change in authorization check placement likely reflects a stricter adherence to business rules, ensuring that each action is individually authorized, enhancing data integrity and security.

### Impact on Clients

The changes are primarily internal to the system. Clients might indirectly benefit from improved data integrity and reduced risk of unauthorized modifications.  However, there's a potential for unexpected behavior if the authorization status changes between actions in the HERITAGE version.

## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

- **Confirm Intent:** Verify if the change in authorization check placement (from a single check to multiple checks) aligns with the intended business rules and security requirements.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the implications of the changes with relevant stakeholders (business analysts, database administrators, and other developers) to ensure everyone understands the impact and agrees on the preferred approach.

### Test Thoroughly

- **Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases to cover all scenarios, including various authorization statuses and action types (add, edit, delete).  Pay special attention to edge cases and boundary conditions.

- **Validate Outcomes:**  Compare the results of the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions to identify any discrepancies.  Ensure that the NEW_GEMINIA version correctly handles all scenarios and maintains data integrity.

### Merge Strategy

- **Conditional Merge:** A conditional merge strategy might be appropriate.  This would involve carefully analyzing the differences and merging the changes selectively based on the review of business requirements and testing results.

- **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  If possible, maintain backward compatibility by adding a configuration parameter or flag to control the authorization check behavior. This allows for a gradual transition and minimizes disruption.

### Update Documentation

Thoroughly update the procedure's documentation to reflect the changes made, including the revised logic, exception handling, and any potential impact on clients.

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Consistent Exception Handling:**  Standardize exception handling across the entire package to ensure consistency and improve maintainability.

- **Clean Up Code:**  Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.  Consider using more descriptive variable names and comments.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and documentation updates.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes to the authorization check placement and retain the HERITAGE version's logic.  Address the other improvements (formatting, error messages) separately.

- **If Uncertain:** Conduct further investigation to clarify the business requirements and the intended behavior.  Perform additional testing to assess the impact of the changes.


## Additional Considerations

- **Database Integrity:** The changes should not negatively impact database integrity if tested thoroughly.  The stricter authorization checks might even improve integrity.

- **Performance Impact:** The addition of multiple authorization checks might slightly impact performance.  However, the impact is likely to be negligible unless the procedure is called extremely frequently.  Profiling should be done to confirm.

- **Error Messages:** The improved error messages in the NEW_GEMINIA version significantly enhance debugging and troubleshooting capabilities.


## Conclusion

The changes to the `update_risk_excesses` procedure introduce improvements in error handling, formatting, and potentially stricter adherence to business rules regarding authorization. However, the change in the placement of the authorization check requires careful review and thorough testing to ensure it aligns with business requirements and does not introduce unintended consequences.  A phased rollout with backward compatibility might be beneficial to minimize disruption.
