# PL/SQL Procedure `get_policy_no` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `get_policy_no` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

**HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic for constructing the policy and endorsement numbers was nested within a large `IF v_policy_no IS NULL` block.  This made the code harder to read and understand.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The conditional logic is slightly restructured and more clearly separated into distinct blocks for policy number generation, endorsement number generation, and batch number assignment.  This improves readability and maintainability.


### Modification of WHERE Clauses

**Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed or added in the `WHERE` clause of the `SELECT` statement within the procedure.  The `WHERE` clause remains consistent across both versions.


### Exception Handling Adjustments

**HERITAGE Version:** The exception handling was somewhat inconsistent.  Different exceptions were handled with different levels of detail in error messages.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The exception handling is slightly improved with more consistent error messages.  However, the overall structure remains similar.  The `raise_error` function is used consistently.


### Formatting and Indentation

The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, making the code significantly more readable and easier to follow.  Parameter lists are broken across multiple lines for better readability.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

**Priority Shift:** The core logic for generating policy and endorsement numbers remains unchanged.  There is no direct impact on fee determination as the procedure doesn't calculate fees.

**Potential Outcome Difference:** The restructuring of the code does not change the output of the procedure.  The generated policy and endorsement numbers should be identical for the same input parameters in both versions.


### Business Rule Alignment

The changes primarily focus on code readability and maintainability.  There's no apparent change to the underlying business rules for generating policy and endorsement numbers.


### Impact on Clients

The changes are internal to the procedure and should not have any direct impact on clients.  The functionality remains the same.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

**Confirm Intent:** Verify that the formatting and minor exception handling improvements align with the overall project goals.  The core logic hasn't changed, so the business impact is minimal.

### Consult Stakeholders

Consult with developers and business analysts to confirm that the changes are acceptable and do not introduce unintended consequences.


### Test Thoroughly

**Create Test Cases:** Create comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions, to ensure the functionality remains unchanged after merging.  Pay particular attention to the exception handling.

**Validate Outcomes:**  Compare the output of the NEW_GEMINIA version with the HERITAGE version for a wide range of input parameters.  Ensure that the generated policy and endorsement numbers are identical.


### Merge Strategy

**Conditional Merge:** A straightforward merge is possible.  The improved formatting and minor exception handling enhancements are beneficial and should be included.

**Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  The changes are unlikely to break existing functionality.  However, thorough testing is crucial to confirm backward compatibility.


### Update Documentation

Update the procedure's documentation to reflect the changes in formatting and exception handling.


### Code Quality Improvements

**Consistent Exception Handling:**  While improved, the exception handling could be further standardized.  Consider using a single, centralized exception handling block to improve consistency and maintainability.

**Clean Up Code:** Remove the commented-out lines (`--v_policy_no := ...`).


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

**If the Change Aligns with Business Goals (which it appears to):** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing.

**If the Change Does Not Align:**  Revert the changes and address the concerns before merging.

**If Uncertain:** Conduct further investigation and testing to clarify any uncertainties before merging.


## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

The changes should not affect database integrity.  The core logic for generating policy numbers remains unchanged.

### Performance Impact

The performance impact is expected to be negligible.  The changes are primarily focused on code readability and maintainability.

### Error Messages

The error messages are slightly improved in the NEW_GEMINIA version, providing more context.  However, further standardization could enhance clarity and consistency.


## Conclusion

The changes in the `get_policy_no` procedure are primarily focused on improving code readability, maintainability, and slightly enhancing exception handling.  The core functionality remains unchanged.  After thorough testing and stakeholder consultation, merging the NEW_GEMINIA version is recommended.  Further improvements to exception handling consistency are suggested for future enhancements.
