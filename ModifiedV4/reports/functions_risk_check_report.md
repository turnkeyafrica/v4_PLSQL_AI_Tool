# PL/SQL Function `risk_check` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL function `risk_check` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

- **HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic (`IF NVL(v_count, 0) > 0 THEN ... ELSE ... END IF;`) was nested within the exception handling block. This means the conditional check was only performed if the `SELECT` statement executed successfully.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The conditional logic is now outside the exception handling block. This means the check is performed regardless of whether the `SELECT` statement encountered an exception.  The exception handling now directly returns 'N' or raises a custom error.


### Modification of WHERE Clauses

- **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed or added in the `WHERE` clause. The formatting and spacing have been improved for readability.


### Exception Handling Adjustments

- **HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version only handled the `NO_DATA_FOUND` exception.  Other exceptions were not explicitly caught.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version now explicitly handles the `OTHERS` exception, raising a more informative custom error message instead of relying on the default exception handling.  This improves error reporting and debugging.


### Formatting and Indentation

- The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, enhancing code readability and maintainability.  Parameter lists are more clearly formatted, and the overall structure is cleaner.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

- **Priority Shift:**
    - **HERITAGE:** The HERITAGE version prioritizes checking the count only if the initial query was successful.  If an error other than `NO_DATA_FOUND` occurred, the function's behavior was undefined (likely a system exception).
    - **NEW_GEMINIA:** The NEW_GEMINIA version prioritizes reporting an error if any exception occurs during the database query. If no exception occurs, it then checks the count.

- **Potential Outcome Difference:** The primary difference lies in how errors are handled. The NEW_GEMINIA version provides more robust error handling, preventing unexpected behavior in case of database errors beyond `NO_DATA_FOUND`.  The logic change in the conditional statement placement could also lead to different outcomes if unexpected exceptions occur during the database query.


### Business Rule Alignment

The changes might or might not align with the business rules depending on how errors are handled.  The improved error handling in the NEW_GEMINIA version is generally a positive change, but the reordering of the conditional statement needs careful review to ensure it still reflects the intended business logic.


### Impact on Clients

The changes might not directly impact clients unless an error occurs during the database query. The improved error handling in the NEW_GEMINIA version could lead to more informative error messages, potentially improving client support. However, the change in the conditional logic's placement could subtly alter the function's behavior, potentially leading to unexpected results for clients.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

- **Confirm Intent:** Carefully review the business requirements to confirm if the reordering of the conditional logic is intentional and aligns with the desired behavior in case of database errors.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with stakeholders (business analysts, database administrators, and other developers) to ensure the modifications meet the business needs and do not introduce unintended consequences.

### Test Thoroughly

- **Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including successful queries, `NO_DATA_FOUND` exceptions, and other potential exceptions.  Test cases should cover both the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions to compare outcomes.

- **Validate Outcomes:** Verify that the NEW_GEMINIA version produces the expected results in all scenarios and that the changes do not introduce regressions.

### Merge Strategy

- **Conditional Merge:**  A conditional merge is recommended.  Thoroughly test the NEW_GEMINIA version before deploying it to production.  Consider a phased rollout to minimize risk.

- **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  If backward compatibility is crucial, consider creating a new function with a different name for the NEW_GEMINIA version. This allows both versions to coexist until a complete migration can be performed.

### Update Documentation

Update the package documentation to reflect the changes made to the `risk_check` function, including the updated exception handling and any changes in behavior.

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Consistent Exception Handling:**  Maintain consistent exception handling throughout the package.  The improved exception handling in the NEW_GEMINIA version should be applied consistently to other functions.

- **Clean Up Code:**  Maintain consistent formatting and indentation throughout the package.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and documentation updates.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes and restore the HERITAGE version.  Investigate why the changes were made and address the underlying issues.

- **If Uncertain:** Conduct further investigation and testing to clarify the impact of the changes. Consult with stakeholders to determine the intended behavior.


## Additional Considerations

- **Database Integrity:** The changes should not affect database integrity.

- **Performance Impact:** The performance impact is likely minimal.  However, it should be monitored after deployment.

- **Error Messages:** The improved error messages in the NEW_GEMINIA version enhance debugging and troubleshooting.


## Conclusion

The changes to the `risk_check` function introduce improved error handling and code readability. However, the reordering of the conditional logic requires careful review to ensure it aligns with the intended business logic.  Thorough testing and stakeholder consultation are crucial before merging the NEW_GEMINIA version into production.  A phased rollout approach is recommended to minimize disruption and allow for timely detection and correction of any unforeseen issues.
