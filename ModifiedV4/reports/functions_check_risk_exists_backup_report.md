# PL/SQL Function `check_risk_exists_backup` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL function `check_risk_exists_backup` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

**HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version has nested `BEGIN...EXCEPTION...END` blocks. The outer block handles the retrieval of the `ALLOW_DUPLICATION_OF_RISKS` parameter, while the inner block performs the count query and subsequent logic.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version separates the parameter retrieval and the count query into distinct `BEGIN...EXCEPTION...END` blocks. This improves readability and maintainability.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

**Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed from the `WHERE` clause.  The `WHERE` clause remains largely the same, suggesting no fundamental change to the data selection criteria.  However, the formatting has been improved for readability.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

**HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version has a single `WHEN OTHERS` exception handler within the nested blocks, catching any errors during parameter retrieval and the count query.  Error messages are not very specific.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version maintains separate exception handlers for each `BEGIN...EXCEPTION...END` block. This allows for more granular error handling and potentially more informative error messages.  The error message is still generic.

### Formatting and Indentation

The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, making the code significantly more readable and easier to understand.  Parameter lists are broken across multiple lines for better readability.

## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

**Priority Shift:** The core logic of checking for duplicate risks remains unchanged.  The function still counts risks based on specified criteria.

**HERITAGE:** The nested structure might have slightly obscured the flow of logic.

**NEW_GEMINIA:** The separated blocks clarify the distinct steps: parameter retrieval and risk count.

**Potential Outcome Difference:** No change in the core functionality is expected, provided the `gin_parameters_pkg.get_param_varchar` function remains consistent.

### Business Rule Alignment

The changes primarily affect code structure and readability, not the underlying business rules.  The function still performs the same core task of checking for duplicate risks.

### Impact on Clients

The changes are internal to the application and should not directly impact clients.  The functionality remains the same.

## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

**Confirm Intent:** Verify that the structural changes in the NEW_GEMINIA version are intentional and do not alter the intended behavior of the function.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with relevant stakeholders (developers, testers, business analysts) to ensure alignment with project goals and to address any potential concerns.

### Test Thoroughly

**Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases to cover various scenarios, including successful and unsuccessful risk checks, and different values for `ALLOW_DUPLICATION_OF_RISKS`.  Pay close attention to edge cases and boundary conditions.

**Validate Outcomes:**  Compare the results of the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions for all test cases to ensure functional equivalence.

### Merge Strategy

**Conditional Merge:**  A direct merge is feasible, given the changes are primarily structural.  However, careful review and testing are crucial.

**Maintain Backward Compatibility:** Ensure that the changes do not break existing integrations or dependencies.

### Update Documentation

Update the package documentation to reflect the changes made to the function, including the improved exception handling and formatting.

### Code Quality Improvements

**Consistent Exception Handling:** Standardize exception handling throughout the package to improve maintainability and consistency.  Consider adding more specific exception types and more informative error messages.

**Clean Up Code:**  Apply consistent formatting and indentation rules across the entire package.

## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

**If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and documentation updates.

**If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes and investigate why the structural modifications were made.

**If Uncertain:** Conduct further analysis and testing to determine the impact of the changes before making a decision.

## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

The changes should not affect database integrity, as the core data access logic remains unchanged.

### Performance Impact

The performance impact is expected to be minimal, as the changes are primarily structural.  However, performance testing is recommended to confirm this.

### Error Messages

The error messages are generic.  Improving the error messages to provide more context and information would enhance the function's usability and debugging capabilities.

## Conclusion

The changes to the `check_risk_exists_backup` function primarily improve code readability, maintainability, and exception handling.  The core functionality remains unchanged.  A careful merge process, including thorough testing and stakeholder consultation, is recommended to ensure a smooth transition and maintain the integrity of the application.  Improving the error messages should be considered as a future enhancement.
