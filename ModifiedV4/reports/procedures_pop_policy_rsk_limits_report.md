# PL/SQL Procedure `pop_policy_rsk_limits` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `pop_policy_rsk_limits` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

**HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic (`IF NVL(v_pol_binder,'N') = 'Y' THEN`) was placed after the block that retrieves `v_pol_binder`, `v_ncd_status`, and `v_ncd_level` from the database.  The logic to process sections only executed if the policy was a binder policy.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The conditional logic remains largely the same, but the formatting and structure have been significantly improved.  The core logic remains unchanged.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

**Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed or added within the core `WHERE` clause of the `pil_cur` cursor.  The query remains functionally equivalent in terms of the data it selects.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

**HERITAGE Version:** Exception handling was present but less structured.  The `WHEN OTHERS` clause used a custom `raise_error` function, which is good practice. However, the error messages were somewhat generic.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** Exception handling is improved with more descriptive error messages within the `raise_when_others` function call.  The structure is more consistent.

### Formatting and Indentation

**HERITAGE Version:** The code was less readable due to inconsistent indentation and formatting.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The code has been significantly reformatted with improved indentation and spacing, enhancing readability and maintainability.  This is a purely cosmetic change that doesn't affect functionality.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

**Priority Shift:** The core fee determination logic (how premiums and limits are calculated and inserted) remains unchanged.  The order of operations is slightly improved in the new version due to the improved formatting.

**Potential Outcome Difference:** There should be no difference in the calculated fees or the data inserted into the `gin_policy_insured_limits` table.

### Business Rule Alignment

The changes do not appear to alter any core business rules.  The primary change is in code formatting and readability.

### Impact on Clients

The changes should be transparent to clients as the core functionality remains the same.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

**Confirm Intent:** Verify that the formatting changes align with coding standards and that no unintended logical changes were introduced.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with relevant stakeholders (developers, testers, business analysts) to ensure everyone understands the intent and impact of the modifications.

### Test Thoroughly

**Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including binder and non-binder policies, different section types, and edge cases.  Pay particular attention to the exception handling.

**Validate Outcomes:** Compare the results of the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions for identical input data to ensure no discrepancies exist.

### Merge Strategy

**Conditional Merge:** A direct merge is feasible after thorough testing.  The formatting changes can be merged directly.

**Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  The functional changes are minimal, so backward compatibility should be maintained.

### Update Documentation

Update the procedure's documentation to reflect any changes in error handling or behavior (though functional changes are minimal).

### Code Quality Improvements

**Consistent Exception Handling:**  Standardize the exception handling mechanism across the entire package to use the improved `raise_when_others` function consistently.

**Clean Up Code:**  Apply the improved formatting and indentation style consistently throughout the package.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

**If the Change Aligns with Business Goals (which it appears to):** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing.

**If the Change Does Not Align:**  Revert the changes and investigate why they were made.

**If Uncertain:** Conduct further analysis and testing to clarify the impact of the changes before merging.


## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

The changes should not affect database integrity provided the testing phase is comprehensive.

### Performance Impact

The formatting changes should have a negligible impact on performance.

### Error Messages

The improved error messages in the NEW_GEMINIA version enhance debugging and troubleshooting.


## Conclusion

The primary changes in the `pop_policy_rsk_limits` procedure are improvements in code formatting, readability, and exception handling.  The core logic remains largely unchanged.  After thorough testing, the NEW_GEMINIA version should be merged to improve the codebase's quality and maintainability.  The improved error messages will also benefit debugging and maintenance efforts.
