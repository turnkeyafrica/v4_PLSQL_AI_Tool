# PL/SQL Procedure `pop_loading_rsk_limits` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `pop_loading_rsk_limits` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

**HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version processes all risk sections and then handles NCD sections separately in a subsequent loop, after checking if the policy binder is not 'Y'.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version maintains the same overall logic but integrates the processing of NCD sections within the main loop, handling them alongside other risk sections.  This change eliminates the need for a separate loop for NCD processing.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

**Removal and Addition of Conditions:** The `WHERE` clause in the `pil_cur` cursor has been significantly restructured. The original version had three nearly identical `UNION`ed selects. The NEW_GEMINIA version has consolidated these into a single `UNION ALL` query, improving readability and potentially performance.  Furthermore, the NEW_GEMINIA version now incorporates a subquery to fetch `SCVTS_ORDER` and `SCVTS_CALC_GROUP` from `GIN_SUBCL_COVT_SECTIONS`, adding a new layer of logic to determine the calculation group and row number for each section.  This introduces a new dependency on the `GIN_SUBCL_COVT_SECTIONS` table.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

**HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version uses a generic `WHEN OTHERS` exception handler within the main loop and outside it.  This provides minimal information about the error.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version retains the generic `WHEN OTHERS` exception handler but also adds more specific exception handling within nested blocks for database operations. This improvement allows for more precise error identification and handling.  However, the error messages remain relatively generic.

### Formatting and Indentation

The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, enhancing readability and maintainability.  The code is broken down into smaller, more manageable blocks.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

**Priority Shift:** The HERITAGE version prioritizes processing all sections except NCDs first, then handles NCDs. The NEW_GEMINIA version processes all sections, including NCDs, within a single loop, potentially changing the order of processing.  The addition of the `GIN_SUBCL_COVT_SECTIONS` subquery introduces a new logic layer for determining the calculation group and row number, which could impact the order and grouping of premium calculations.

**Potential Outcome Difference:** The reordering of conditional logic and the addition of the `SCVTS_ORDER` and `SCVTS_CALC_GROUP` logic *could* lead to different results, particularly if the order of processing affects calculations or if there are dependencies between different section types.  This is a critical area requiring thorough testing.

### Business Rule Alignment

The changes might reflect a shift in business rules regarding the calculation and ordering of premiums for different risk sections. The use of `GIN_SUBCL_COVT_SECTIONS` suggests a more granular control over premium calculation based on sub-class, coverage, and section order.  This needs verification against the updated business requirements.

### Impact on Clients

The changes could potentially affect the calculation of premiums for clients.  If the changes alter the order of premium calculations or introduce new logic, it could lead to discrepancies in the final premium amounts.  This necessitates comprehensive regression testing.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

**Confirm Intent:**  Thoroughly review the business requirements to confirm if the changes in logic and the introduction of the `GIN_SUBCL_COVT_SECTIONS` dependency align with the intended business goals.  Document the rationale behind these changes.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with relevant stakeholders (business analysts, testers, and other developers) to ensure everyone understands the implications and agrees with the modifications.

### Test Thoroughly

**Create Test Cases:**  Develop comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions, to validate the accuracy and consistency of the premium calculations.  Pay special attention to the impact of the new calculation group and row number logic.

**Validate Outcomes:**  Compare the results of the NEW_GEMINIA version with the HERITAGE version for a large sample of data to identify any discrepancies.  Investigate and resolve any differences.

### Merge Strategy

**Conditional Merge:**  A conditional merge strategy might be appropriate.  This could involve creating a new procedure or modifying the existing one with a flag to control the behavior (using the old or new logic).  This allows for a phased rollout and minimizes disruption.

**Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  Ensure backward compatibility by maintaining the HERITAGE version until the NEW_GEMINIA version is thoroughly tested and validated.

### Update Documentation

Update the package documentation to reflect the changes made, including the new logic, dependencies, and potential impacts.

### Code Quality Improvements

**Consistent Exception Handling:**  Improve the exception handling by providing more informative error messages.  Instead of generic messages, provide specific details about the error, including the affected table, column, and the error code.

**Clean Up Code:**  Further refine the code formatting and indentation for better readability.  Consider refactoring the repeated `DECODE` statements into separate functions for improved maintainability.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

**If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:**  Proceed with the merge after thorough testing and documentation updates.

**If the Change Does Not Align:**  Revert the changes and investigate the discrepancy between the implemented changes and the business requirements.

**If Uncertain:**  Conduct further analysis and testing to understand the impact of the changes before proceeding with the merge.


## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

Verify that the changes do not compromise database integrity.  Ensure that the new logic does not introduce data inconsistencies or errors.

### Performance Impact

Assess the performance impact of the changes, particularly the addition of the `GIN_SUBCL_COVT_SECTIONS` subquery.  Consider optimizing the queries if necessary.

### Error Messages

Improve the error messages to provide more context and information for debugging and troubleshooting.


## Conclusion

The changes to `pop_loading_rsk_limits` introduce significant alterations to the premium calculation logic.  While the code improvements in formatting and structure are beneficial, the core logic changes require careful review, thorough testing, and validation against business requirements to ensure accuracy and prevent unintended consequences for clients.  A phased rollout with a conditional merge strategy is recommended to minimize risk and maintain backward compatibility.  The improved exception handling is a positive step, but further enhancement is needed for more informative error messages.
