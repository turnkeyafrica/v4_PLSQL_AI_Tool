# PL/SQL Procedure `create_midterm_trans` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `create_midterm_trans` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

**HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic related to reinsurance checks (`NVL (cur_pol_rec.pol_reinsured, 'N') != 'Y'`) and organization type (`tqc_interfaces_pkg.get_org_type (37) = 'INS'`) was placed before the policy prefix retrieval. This meant that the prefix check was only performed if the reinsurance and organization type conditions were met.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The order is reversed.  The policy prefix check is now performed first. This ensures that the product prefix is always validated, regardless of the reinsurance or organization type.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

**Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed from the `WHERE` clauses of the cursors. However, the `cur_taxes` cursor in the NEW_GEMINIA version now explicitly uses `AND NVL (ptx_trac_trnt_code, 'XX') != 'SD'`, which was implicitly handled (or possibly missing) in the HERITAGE version. This clarifies the intent of excluding records with `ptx_trac_trnt_code = 'SD'`.  Additionally, the `cur_ipu` and other cursors now use more explicit `WHERE` clause formatting.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

**HERITAGE Version:** Exception handling was present but lacked consistency.  `WHEN OTHERS` blocks were used without specific error codes, making debugging difficult.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** Exception handling is improved with more specific `WHEN OTHERS` blocks and more informative error messages.  The `WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND` exception is explicitly handled in several places, preventing unexpected behavior.

### Formatting and Indentation

The NEW_GEMINIA version shows significant improvements in formatting and indentation, making the code much more readable and maintainable.  The code is broken into smaller, more manageable blocks.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

**Priority Shift:**
    - **HERITAGE:** The reinsurance and organization type checks were prioritized over the product prefix validation.
    - **NEW_GEMINIA:** Product prefix validation is now prioritized.

**Potential Outcome Difference:** The change in order could lead to different outcomes if a policy lacks a defined prefix. In the HERITAGE version, this might have resulted in the procedure skipping the prefix check entirely under certain conditions.  The NEW_GEMINIA version will always perform this check, leading to a more consistent and robust error handling.

### Business Rule Alignment

The NEW_GEMINIA version better aligns with the likely business rule that a product must have a defined prefix before any other processing occurs. The explicit `ptx_trac_trnt_code` check in `cur_taxes` also clarifies a business rule that was previously unclear or inconsistently applied.

### Impact on Clients

The changes are primarily internal to the system.  However, the improved error handling in the NEW_GEMINIA version should lead to more informative error messages for users, improving the overall user experience.  The changes should not directly impact client data, but thorough testing is crucial.

## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

**Confirm Intent:** Verify that the reordering of conditional logic and the explicit addition of the `ptx_trac_trnt_code` condition accurately reflect the intended business rules.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with relevant stakeholders (business analysts, users, etc.) to ensure that the updated logic aligns with their expectations.

### Test Thoroughly

**Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions, to validate the functionality of both versions and the differences between them.  Pay special attention to cases where the reinsurance or organization type conditions are true or false, and where the policy prefix is missing or invalid.

**Validate Outcomes:** Compare the results of the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions with expected outcomes for each test case.

### Merge Strategy

**Conditional Merge:**  A conditional merge is recommended.  First, thoroughly test the NEW_GEMINIA version.  Then, merge the improved formatting, exception handling, and the explicit `WHERE` clause conditions.  The reordering of conditional logic should be carefully evaluated and potentially merged only after a thorough impact assessment.

**Maintain Backward Compatibility:** If the reordering of the conditional logic significantly alters the behavior, consider maintaining backward compatibility by creating a new procedure name (e.g., `create_midterm_trans_v2`) for the NEW_GEMINIA version.

### Update Documentation

Update the package documentation to reflect the changes made to the procedure, including the rationale behind the changes and any potential impact on users.

### Code Quality Improvements

**Consistent Exception Handling:**  Adopt the improved exception handling style of the NEW_GEMINIA version throughout the package.

**Clean Up Code:** Apply the improved formatting and indentation style consistently across the entire package.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

**If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and stakeholder consultation.

**If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes and investigate the reasons for the discrepancy between the intended business rules and the implemented logic.

**If Uncertain:** Conduct further analysis and testing to clarify the impact of the changes before making a decision.


## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

The changes should not affect database integrity if properly tested.  However, it's crucial to back up the database before implementing any changes.

### Performance Impact

The changes are unlikely to have a significant performance impact, but performance testing should be conducted to ensure that the updated procedure meets performance requirements.

### Error Messages

The improved error messages in the NEW_GEMINIA version are a significant improvement.  Ensure that all error messages are clear, concise, and helpful to users.


## Conclusion

The changes to the `create_midterm_trans` procedure in the NEW_GEMINIA version represent a significant improvement in code quality, error handling, and clarity. The reordering of conditional logic requires careful consideration and testing to ensure that it aligns with business requirements and does not introduce unintended consequences.  A phased merge approach, prioritizing improved error handling and formatting, is recommended.  Thorough testing is crucial before deploying the updated procedure to a production environment.
