# PL/SQL Procedure `update_coinsurance_share` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `update_coinsurance_share` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.


## Summary of Key Changes:

### Reordering of Conditional Logic:

- **HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic (`IF NVL (v_leader, 'N') = 'Y' THEN ... END IF;`) was placed before the `UPDATE` statement.  The leader check happened first, and the update only proceeded if a leader wasn't already set.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The conditional logic remains, but the `UPDATE` statement is now unconditionally executed. The leader check now acts as a pre-update validation, raising an error if a leader already exists.  The order of operations has changed.


### Modification of WHERE Clauses:

- **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No changes were made to the `WHERE` clause of the `UPDATE` statement in the original diff. However, the NEW_GEMINIA version adds new columns `POL_COIN_FAC_CESSION` and `POL_COIN_FAC_PC` to the `UPDATE` statement.  These columns are updated with `v_fac_appl` and `v_fac_pcnt` respectively.  The procedure also gains two new input parameters: `v_fac_appl` and `v_fac_pcnt`.

### Exception Handling Adjustments:

- **HERITAGE Version:** The `WHEN OTHERS` exception handler in the `SELECT` statement and the main `UPDATE` statement both simply called `raise_error` with generic messages.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The `WHEN OTHERS` exception handler in the `SELECT` statement now provides a more descriptive error message ("Error fetching the existing coinsurers...").  The main `UPDATE` statement's exception handling remains largely unchanged.


### Formatting and Indentation:

- The code formatting and indentation have been slightly improved in the NEW_GEMINIA version, leading to better readability.


## Implications of the Changes:

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination:

- **Priority Shift:**
    - **HERITAGE:** The leader check acted as a gatekeeper; the `UPDATE` only happened if no leader was present.
    - **NEW_GEMINIA:** The leader check is now a validation step. The `UPDATE` always executes, but an error is raised if a leader already exists.

- **Potential Outcome Difference:** The core logic of updating `pol_coinsurance_share`, `pol_coin_fee`, and `pol_coinsure_leader` remains the same. However, the error handling is more robust, and the addition of the `v_fac_appl` and `v_fac_pcnt` parameters introduces new functionality related to facultative cession.  The HERITAGE version would silently fail to update if a leader already existed; the NEW_GEMINIA version will explicitly report an error.

### Business Rule Alignment:

The changes suggest a refinement of the business rules. The explicit error handling for existing leaders improves data integrity and provides clearer feedback to users. The addition of facultative cession parameters indicates an expansion of the procedure's functionality.

### Impact on Clients:

Clients will experience improved error reporting.  The addition of facultative cession parameters will allow for more comprehensive data management, but requires updates to any client applications that use this procedure.


## Recommendations for Merging:

### Review Business Requirements:

- **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the changes in the NEW_GEMINIA version accurately reflect the updated business requirements, particularly the addition of facultative cession handling.

### Consult Stakeholders:

Discuss the changes with relevant stakeholders (business analysts, testers, and clients) to ensure alignment with expectations.

### Test Thoroughly:

- **Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases covering all scenarios, including the presence and absence of a coinsurance leader, and various values for `v_fac_appl` and `v_fac_pcnt`.  Pay close attention to edge cases and error handling.

- **Validate Outcomes:**  Rigorously validate the results of the test cases to ensure the procedure behaves as expected.

### Merge Strategy:

- **Conditional Merge:**  A conditional merge is recommended.  Carefully review each change and ensure that it aligns with the intended functionality.

- **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  Consider creating a new procedure name (e.g., `update_coinsurance_share_v2`) to maintain backward compatibility for existing applications relying on the HERITAGE version.

### Update Documentation:

Thoroughly update the procedure's documentation to reflect the changes, including the new parameters and their purpose, and the improved error handling.

### Code Quality Improvements:

- **Consistent Exception Handling:** Standardize exception handling throughout the procedure and the package.  Consider using a centralized exception-handling mechanism.

- **Clean Up Code:**  Refactor the code for better readability and maintainability.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis:

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the changes after thorough testing and documentation updates.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes and address the discrepancies with stakeholders.

- **If Uncertain:** Conduct further investigation and clarification with stakeholders before proceeding.


## Additional Considerations:

### Database Integrity:

The changes enhance database integrity by providing more robust error handling and preventing the accidental overwriting of existing leader information.

### Performance Impact:

The performance impact is likely to be minimal, as the added logic is relatively simple.  However, performance testing should be conducted to confirm this.

### Error Messages:

The improved error messages enhance user experience and facilitate debugging.


## Conclusion:

The changes to the `update_coinsurance_share` procedure introduce improvements in error handling, add functionality related to facultative cession, and enhance data integrity.  However, a thorough review of business requirements, stakeholder consultation, and rigorous testing are crucial before merging these changes into production.  Maintaining backward compatibility by creating a new procedure name is also strongly recommended.
