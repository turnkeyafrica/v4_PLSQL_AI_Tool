# PL/SQL Procedure `del_risk_details` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `del_risk_details` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

**HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version's logic was less structured, with conditional checks interspersed throughout the deletion process.  The certificate handling logic was nested deeply within the main deletion flow.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version significantly restructures the logic.  The certificate check is performed upfront, preventing unnecessary deletion operations if certificates exist. This improves efficiency and clarity.  The deletion of various tables is more clearly organized.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

**Removal and Addition of Conditions:** Several `DELETE` statements have been modified to include more specific `WHERE` clauses, enhancing the precision of data deletion.  The addition of `v_pol_batch_no` to some `WHERE` clauses ensures that only the relevant records are deleted.  The NEW_GEMINIA version also adds checks for the existence of claims associated with the risk before proceeding with the deletion.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

**HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version uses `raise_application_error` for most exceptions, which might not be ideal for all scenarios.  Error messages were somewhat generic.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version improves exception handling by using a single `OUT` parameter `v_error` to return error messages. This allows for more controlled error handling at the calling procedure level.  The specific error location (`v_err_pos`) is recorded, providing more context.  The `raise_application_error` calls are mostly replaced with more graceful error handling using `v_error` and `RETURN`.

### Formatting and Indentation

The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, making the code significantly more readable and maintainable.  The code is broken down into smaller, more manageable blocks.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

**Priority Shift:** The HERITAGE version implicitly prioritized deleting risk details before checking for the existence of certificates. The NEW_GEMINIA version prioritizes checking for certificates first, preventing unnecessary deletions and potential data inconsistencies.

**Potential Outcome Difference:** The HERITAGE version might have deleted risk details even if associated certificates existed, leading to data inconsistencies. The NEW_GEMINIA version prevents this by raising an error if certificates are found.

### Business Rule Alignment

The NEW_GEMINIA version better aligns with the likely business rule of preventing deletion of risks with associated certificates.  The addition of claim checks further strengthens data integrity by preventing deletion of risks with active claims.

### Impact on Clients

The changes should improve data integrity and prevent potential errors.  However, the stricter rules around certificate existence and claims might impact clients if they attempt to delete risks with existing certificates or claims.  Clear communication of these new restrictions is crucial.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

**Confirm Intent:** Verify that the changes in the NEW_GEMINIA version accurately reflect the intended business requirements for deleting risk details.  Specifically, confirm the decision to prevent deletion if certificates or claims exist.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with relevant stakeholders (business users, testers, and other developers) to ensure everyone understands the implications and agrees with the approach.

### Test Thoroughly

**Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including successful deletions, deletions with existing certificates, deletions with claims, and error handling.  Test cases should cover boundary conditions and edge cases.

**Validate Outcomes:** Carefully validate the results of the test cases to ensure the procedure behaves as expected in all scenarios.

### Merge Strategy

**Conditional Merge:**  A conditional merge is recommended.  Thoroughly review the changes and ensure that the improved error handling and certificate/claim checks are incorporated.

**Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  Consider adding a parameter to control the behavior (e.g., a flag to allow deletion even if certificates exist, for backward compatibility during a transition period).  This would allow for a phased rollout.

### Update Documentation

Update the procedure's documentation to reflect the changes in logic, error handling, and business rules.  Clearly document the new restrictions on deleting risks with certificates or claims.

### Code Quality Improvements

**Consistent Exception Handling:**  Maintain consistent exception handling throughout the package, using the improved approach from the NEW_GEMINIA version.

**Clean Up Code:**  Apply consistent formatting and indentation to the entire package to improve readability and maintainability.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

**If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and stakeholder consultation.

**If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes and investigate why the business requirements were not accurately reflected in the NEW_GEMINIA version.

**If Uncertain:** Conduct further analysis and testing to clarify the impact of the changes before deciding on a merge strategy.


## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

The changes enhance database integrity by preventing the deletion of risks with associated certificates or claims.

### Performance Impact

The additional checks might slightly impact performance, but the overall improvement in data integrity outweighs this minor performance overhead.  Profiling should be done to confirm this.

### Error Messages

The improved error messages in the NEW_GEMINIA version provide more context and are more helpful for debugging and troubleshooting.


## Conclusion

The changes in the `del_risk_details` procedure represent a significant improvement in terms of code structure, error handling, and business rule alignment. The stricter checks for certificates and claims enhance data integrity and prevent potential data inconsistencies.  However, a thorough review, testing, and stakeholder consultation are crucial before merging the NEW_GEMINIA version to ensure that the changes align with business requirements and do not negatively impact clients.  A phased rollout with backward compatibility considerations is recommended.
