## PL/SQL Procedure `delete_rsk_limits` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the `delete_rsk_limits` procedure between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

**Summary of Key Changes:**

- **Reordering of Conditional Logic:**
    - **HERITAGE Version:** The `WHERE` clause conditions were spread across multiple lines, potentially impacting readability.
    - **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The `WHERE` clause conditions are now presented more compactly on a single line, improving readability.

- **Modification of WHERE Clauses:**
    - **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed or added.  The logic remains the same; only the formatting changed.

- **Exception Handling Adjustments:**
    - **HERITAGE Version:** No explicit exception handling was present.
    - **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** No explicit exception handling was added.  The lack of exception handling remains a concern.

- **Formatting and Indentation:**
    - The procedure declaration and `WHERE` clause formatting have been significantly improved for readability and conciseness.  The HERITAGE version used unnecessary line breaks and indentation.


**Implications of the Changes:**

- **Logic Alteration in Fee Determination:** The changes do not affect the fee determination logic as the core DELETE statement remains unchanged.

- **Priority Shift:**
    - **HERITAGE:** The order of conditions in the `WHERE` clause, while functionally equivalent, might have implied a certain processing priority (though this is not enforced by the database).
    - **NEW_GEMINIA:** The compact format does not explicitly change the priority. The database optimizer will handle the execution order.

- **Potential Outcome Difference:** There should be no difference in the outcome of the procedure between the two versions, assuming the data remains consistent.

- **Business Rule Alignment:** The changes do not affect the underlying business rules.

- **Impact on Clients:** No direct impact on clients is anticipated, as the core functionality remains unchanged.


**Recommendations for Merging:**

- **Review Business Requirements:**
    - **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the sole intent of the change was to improve code readability and maintainability.

- **Consult Stakeholders:**  While the change seems minor, it's prudent to inform relevant stakeholders (developers, testers, business analysts) about the update.

- **Test Thoroughly:**
    - **Create Test Cases:** Create comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions, to ensure the functionality remains identical.  Pay close attention to the number of rows deleted under different conditions.
    - **Validate Outcomes:** Compare the results of the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions with the expected outcomes for each test case.

- **Merge Strategy:**
    - **Conditional Merge:** A simple direct merge is acceptable, given the nature of the changes.
    - **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  Backward compatibility is maintained as the core functionality remains unchanged.

- **Update Documentation:** Update the package documentation to reflect the formatting changes.

- **Code Quality Improvements:**
    - **Consistent Exception Handling:**  Add robust exception handling (e.g., `WHEN OTHERS THEN`) to handle potential errors during the delete operation (e.g., database errors, insufficient privileges).  Log errors appropriately.
    - **Clean Up Code:**  The improved formatting is a good start.  Consider using more descriptive variable names if appropriate for the context.

**Potential Actions Based on Analysis:**

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals (which it appears to):** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:** This is unlikely, given the nature of the change.  Re-evaluate the business requirements if there's a discrepancy.

- **If Uncertain:** Conduct further investigation and testing to confirm the equivalence of the two versions before merging.


**Additional Considerations:**

- **Database Integrity:** The changes should not affect database integrity, provided the `WHERE` clause conditions accurately reflect the intended deletion criteria.

- **Performance Impact:** The performance impact is expected to be negligible, as the underlying SQL statement remains the same.

- **Error Messages:** The lack of explicit error handling is a significant concern.  Improved error handling should be implemented to provide informative error messages to users and facilitate debugging.


**Conclusion:**

The changes to the `delete_rsk_limits` procedure primarily focus on improving code readability and formatting.  The core functionality remains unchanged.  However, the lack of exception handling is a critical issue that needs to be addressed before merging.  Thorough testing is crucial to ensure the changes do not introduce unintended consequences.  The recommendation is to merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after implementing robust exception handling and completing comprehensive testing.
