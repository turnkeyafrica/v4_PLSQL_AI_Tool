# PL/SQL Procedure `pop_liab_limits` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `pop_liab_limits` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

**HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version lacked any conditional logic; it unconditionally inserted liability limits into `gin_pol_schedule_values` based on the provided product code.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version introduces conditional logic based on a parameter (`AUTO_POP_LIMITS_LIABILITIES`) and the policy transaction type.  The insertion of liability limits now depends on whether automatic population is enabled and whether the transaction type is not 'NB'.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

**Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No changes were made to the `WHERE` clause of the cursor itself. However, the NEW_GEMINIA version implicitly adds conditions to the insertion logic through the conditional statements based on `v_auto_pop_limits_param` and `v_trans_type`.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

**HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version had no explicit exception handling.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version includes a `BEGIN...EXCEPTION...END` block to handle potential exceptions when retrieving the `pol_policy_status` from the `gin_policies` table.  If an exception occurs, `v_trans_type` is set to `NULL`.

### Formatting and Indentation

The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, enhancing readability.  Parameter passing is also improved for better clarity.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

**Priority Shift:**

**HERITAGE:**  Liability limits were always populated regardless of any configuration or policy status.

**NEW_GEMINIA:** Liability limits are populated only if the `AUTO_POP_LIMITS_LIABILITIES` parameter is 'Y' or if it's 'N' and the transaction type is not 'NB'. This introduces a configurable behavior and a dependency on the policy status.

**Potential Outcome Difference:**  The NEW_GEMINIA version may result in fewer records being inserted into `gin_pol_schedule_values` compared to the HERITAGE version, depending on the parameter value and the policy transaction type.  This could significantly impact downstream processes relying on the data in this table.

### Business Rule Alignment

The NEW_GEMINIA version appears to implement new business rules related to the conditional population of liability limits.  These rules provide more control and flexibility but require careful consideration of their implications.

### Impact on Clients

The changes might affect clients depending on how they use the liability limit data.  Clients relying on the previous unconditional population might experience data discrepancies.  Those who utilize the new parameter will have more control over the process.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

**Confirm Intent:**  Thoroughly review the business requirements that led to these changes.  Confirm that the new conditional logic accurately reflects the intended business rules.  Clarify the meaning and implications of the 'NB' transaction type exclusion.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with all relevant stakeholders (business users, testers, other developers) to ensure everyone understands the implications and agrees with the modifications.

### Test Thoroughly

**Create Test Cases:**  Develop comprehensive test cases covering all scenarios:
    * `AUTO_POP_LIMITS_LIABILITIES` = 'Y'
    * `AUTO_POP_LIMITS_LIABILITIES` = 'N' with various transaction types (including 'NB' and others).
    * Error handling scenarios (e.g., `gin_policies` record not found).

**Validate Outcomes:**  Verify that the data inserted into `gin_pol_schedule_values` is correct for each test case and aligns with the expected business rules.

### Merge Strategy

**Conditional Merge:**  A conditional merge is recommended.  The new logic should be carefully integrated, potentially using a configuration flag to allow switching between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA behavior during a transition period.

**Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  Consider maintaining backward compatibility for a defined period to allow clients to adapt to the changes.  This could involve adding a parameter to control the behavior or maintaining a separate procedure for the HERITAGE logic.

### Update Documentation

Update all relevant documentation (package specifications, user manuals) to reflect the changes in the procedure's behavior and the new parameter.

### Code Quality Improvements

**Consistent Exception Handling:**  Implement consistent exception handling throughout the procedure, providing informative error messages to aid debugging and troubleshooting.

**Clean Up Code:**  Further refine the code formatting and indentation for improved readability and maintainability.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

**If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:**  Proceed with the merge after thorough testing and stakeholder consultation.  Implement a phased rollout if necessary.

**If the Change Does Not Align:**  Revert the changes and investigate the reasons for the discrepancy between the intended business rules and the implemented logic.

**If Uncertain:**  Conduct further analysis and clarification with stakeholders before proceeding with the merge.


## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

Ensure that the changes do not compromise database integrity.  Pay close attention to the potential for data inconsistencies during the transition period.

### Performance Impact

Assess the performance impact of the added conditional logic.  The introduction of the parameter lookup and the additional conditional checks might slightly reduce performance.  Monitor performance after deployment.

### Error Messages

Improve the error messages to provide more context and helpful information to users and developers.


## Conclusion

The changes to `pop_liab_limits` introduce significant alterations to the procedure's logic, adding conditional behavior based on a configuration parameter and transaction type.  A thorough review of business requirements, stakeholder consultation, and rigorous testing are crucial before merging these changes into production.  A phased rollout and maintaining backward compatibility during a transition period are strongly recommended to minimize disruption and ensure a smooth transition for clients.
