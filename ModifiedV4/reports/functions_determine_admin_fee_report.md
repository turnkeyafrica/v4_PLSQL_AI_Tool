# PL/SQL Function `determine_admin_fee` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL function `determine_admin_fee` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

- **HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version first checks if `v_admin_count` is 0.  If it is, it proceeds to fetch the count. If the count is greater than 0, it fetches the discount rate.  This approach is less efficient as it involves multiple database queries potentially.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version first attempts to fetch the count using a more specific `WHERE` clause. If no data is found with that clause, it then tries a less specific `WHERE` clause. This is a more efficient approach, minimizing database round trips.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

- **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** The `adf_policy_applicable` column is added to the `WHERE` clause in the primary query in the NEW_GEMINIA version.  The `ADF_POL_POLICY_NO` condition is commented out in both primary and fallback queries. This suggests a change in the business logic regarding policy applicability and potentially the use of policy numbers in fee determination.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

- **HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version has nested exception handlers, making the code harder to read and maintain.  Error messages are somewhat generic.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version maintains a similar structure but with improved formatting and slightly more specific error messages.  However, the nested exception handling remains a potential area for improvement.

### Formatting and Indentation

- The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, enhancing readability and maintainability.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

- **Priority Shift:**
    - **HERITAGE:** Prioritizes a specific `WHERE` clause, but falls back to a broader one if the first query fails.
    - **NEW_GEMINIA:** Prioritizes a more specific `WHERE` clause including `adf_policy_applicable`, falling back to a less specific clause if the first fails.  The removal of `ADF_POL_POLICY_NO` from the `WHERE` clause significantly alters the logic.

- **Potential Outcome Difference:** The changes in the `WHERE` clause could lead to different administration fees being calculated depending on the data in the `gin_adminstration_fee` table.  The removal of the policy number condition will impact the results if policy numbers were previously used to determine the fee.

### Business Rule Alignment

The changes suggest a modification of the business rules for determining administration fees. The inclusion of `adf_policy_applicable` indicates a new requirement to consider policy applicability. The removal of `ADF_POL_POLICY_NO` suggests a change in how policy numbers are used in fee calculation.  This needs clarification.

### Impact on Clients

The changes might affect the administration fees calculated for clients, potentially leading to discrepancies if not properly tested and validated.  This could have financial implications.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

- **Confirm Intent:**  Thoroughly review the business requirements to understand the rationale behind the changes in the `WHERE` clause, particularly the addition of `adf_policy_applicable` and the removal of `ADF_POL_POLICY_NO`.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with relevant stakeholders (business analysts, finance team, etc.) to ensure the new logic aligns with the intended business rules.

### Test Thoroughly

- **Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions, to validate the accuracy of the new function.  Pay close attention to scenarios where `adf_policy_applicable` is 'Y' and 'N', and where `ADF_POL_POLICY_NO` was previously used.

- **Validate Outcomes:** Compare the results of the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions for a representative sample of data to identify any discrepancies.

### Merge Strategy

- **Conditional Merge:**  A conditional merge approach is recommended.  Carefully review the changes and merge them selectively, ensuring that the new logic is correctly implemented and tested.

- **Maintain Backward Compatibility:** If possible, maintain backward compatibility by adding a parameter to control the behavior (e.g., a flag indicating whether to use the new or old logic).  This allows for a phased rollout and minimizes disruption.

### Update Documentation

Update the function's documentation to reflect the changes in logic and behavior.  Clearly explain the impact of the `adf_policy_applicable` column and the removal of the policy number condition.

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Consistent Exception Handling:** Refactor the exception handling to use a more consistent and less nested approach.  Consider using a single exception handler for better maintainability.

- **Clean Up Code:** Remove unnecessary comments and improve code formatting for better readability.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and documentation updates.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes and investigate the discrepancy between the intended business rules and the implemented logic.

- **If Uncertain:** Conduct further investigation and clarification with stakeholders before proceeding with the merge.


## Additional Considerations

- **Database Integrity:** Verify that the changes do not compromise database integrity.

- **Performance Impact:** Assess the performance impact of the changes, especially the added `WHERE` clause conditions.  Consider adding indexes if necessary.

- **Error Messages:** Improve the error messages to provide more specific information to aid in debugging.


## Conclusion

The changes to the `determine_admin_fee` function introduce significant alterations to the fee calculation logic.  A thorough review of business requirements, comprehensive testing, and stakeholder consultation are crucial before merging the NEW_GEMINIA version.  Addressing the exception handling and code formatting will improve maintainability.  Careful consideration of the impact on clients and potential performance implications is also necessary.  A phased rollout with backward compatibility is highly recommended.
