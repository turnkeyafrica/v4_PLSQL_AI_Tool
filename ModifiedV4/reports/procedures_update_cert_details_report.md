# PL/SQL Procedure `update_cert_details` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `update_cert_details` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes:

### Reordering of Conditional Logic:

- **HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic for determining the certificate details (`v_ct_sht_desc`, `v_ct_code`) and passenger/tonnage values was nested within a single `BEGIN...EXCEPTION...END` block.  The primary logic for updating `gin_policy_certs` and `gin_print_cert_queue` was dependent on the outcome of the initial `SELECT` statement.  Error handling was limited to a single `WHEN OTHERS` block.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The conditional logic is more structured. The primary logic is separated into distinct blocks with more granular exception handling.  The nested `IF` statement determining passenger/tonnage updates is now clearly separated from the initial certificate details determination.  The exception handling is improved, with nested `BEGIN...EXCEPTION...END` blocks to handle potential errors at different stages.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses:

- **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** The `WHERE` clause in the `UPDATE` statements for `gin_print_cert_queue` now includes the condition `pcq_status != 'P'`. This addition prevents updates to records with a status of 'P'.

### Exception Handling Adjustments:

- **HERITAGE Version:**  Used a single `WHEN OTHERS` block to catch all exceptions during the initial `SELECT` and subsequent `UPDATE` operations. This lacks specificity and makes debugging difficult.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:**  Employs nested `BEGIN...EXCEPTION...END` blocks, providing more granular exception handling. This allows for more precise error identification and potentially different handling for different types of errors.

### Formatting and Indentation:

- The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, making the code more readable and maintainable.


## Implications of the Changes:

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination:

- **Priority Shift:**
    - **HERITAGE:**  The HERITAGE version prioritized fetching certificate details from `GIN_PRINT_CERT_QUEUE` and falling back to `GIN_POLICY_CERTS` only if an error occurred.
    - **NEW_GEMINIA:** The NEW_GEMINIA version maintains a similar fallback mechanism but with improved error handling and clearer separation of concerns.

- **Potential Outcome Difference:** The addition of `pcq_status != 'P'` in the `WHERE` clause of the `UPDATE` statements for `gin_print_cert_queue` is a significant change.  This will prevent updates to records with a status of 'P', potentially altering the outcome of the procedure.  This needs careful review to ensure it aligns with business requirements.

### Business Rule Alignment:

The changes might reflect a new business rule where records with `pcq_status = 'P'` should not be updated by this procedure.  This needs verification.

### Impact on Clients:

The changes, particularly the addition of the `pcq_status != 'P'` condition, could impact clients if they rely on the procedure to update records with `pcq_status = 'P'`.  This requires thorough testing and communication.


## Recommendations for Merging:

### Review Business Requirements:

- **Confirm Intent:**  Verify the intent behind the addition of `pcq_status != 'P'` and the restructuring of the exception handling.  Clarify if this is a deliberate change in business logic or an unintended consequence.

### Consult Stakeholders:

Discuss the changes with business analysts, testers, and other stakeholders to ensure the new version meets the requirements and does not introduce unintended side effects.

### Test Thoroughly:

- **Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases covering all scenarios, including those with `pcq_status = 'P'` and various error conditions.
- **Validate Outcomes:**  Carefully validate the outcomes of the procedure against the expected results based on the updated business rules.

### Merge Strategy:

- **Conditional Merge:**  A conditional merge strategy might be appropriate, allowing for a phased rollout or a rollback option if issues arise.
- **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  Consider maintaining backward compatibility by creating a new procedure name (e.g., `update_cert_details_v2`) if the changes are significant and cannot be easily rolled back.

### Update Documentation:

Thoroughly update the procedure's documentation to reflect the changes in logic, exception handling, and business rules.

### Code Quality Improvements:

- **Consistent Exception Handling:**  Ensure consistent exception handling throughout the procedure.  Consider using a centralized exception-handling block for better maintainability.
- **Clean Up Code:**  Refactor the code to further improve readability and maintainability.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis:

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and documentation updates.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes or discuss with stakeholders to understand the discrepancy and find a solution that aligns with business requirements.

- **If Uncertain:** Conduct further investigation to clarify the intent of the changes and their impact before making a decision.


## Additional Considerations:

- **Database Integrity:**  Ensure the changes do not compromise database integrity.  Thorough testing is crucial to prevent data corruption.

- **Performance Impact:**  Assess the performance impact of the changes, particularly the nested exception handling and additional `WHERE` clause conditions.

- **Error Messages:**  Improve the error messages to provide more informative feedback to users and developers.


## Conclusion:

The changes to the `update_cert_details` procedure introduce improvements in code structure, exception handling, and potentially a new business rule related to `pcq_status`.  However, the impact of the `pcq_status != 'P'` condition requires careful review and thorough testing before merging.  A phased rollout or a conditional merge strategy is recommended to minimize risk and ensure a smooth transition.  Clear communication with stakeholders is essential throughout the process.
