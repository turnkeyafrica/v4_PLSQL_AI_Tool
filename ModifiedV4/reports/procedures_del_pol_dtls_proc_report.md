# PL/SQL Procedure `del_pol_dtls_proc` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the `del_pol_dtls_proc` procedure between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

- **HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic (`IF v_auths = 'A' THEN ... END IF;`) checking authorization status was placed before the main deletion logic.  This meant authorization was checked before attempting any deletions.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The conditional logic remains in the same place.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

- **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed from the `WHERE` clauses in the `DELETE` statements.  However, the `del_risk_details` procedure call now includes an additional output parameter `v_error_msg` which is concatenated to the error message in the exception handler.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

- **HERITAGE Version:** The exception handler only provided a generic error message based on `SQLCODE`.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The exception handler now provides more context to the error message by including the `v_err_pos` variable indicating the location of the failure and the new `v_error_msg` variable from the `del_risk_details` procedure.  The `raise_error` call is commented out and a `RETURN` statement is added instead.

### Formatting and Indentation

- The code in the NEW_GEMINIA version has improved formatting and indentation, making it more readable.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

- **Priority Shift:** There is no direct impact on fee determination logic in this procedure.

- **Potential Outcome Difference:** The changes primarily affect error handling and logging. The addition of `v_error_msg` provides more detailed error information, which could be beneficial for debugging and troubleshooting. The removal of `raise_error` and the addition of `RETURN` suggests a change in how errors are handled, potentially allowing the calling procedure to handle the error rather than immediately raising an exception.

### Business Rule Alignment

The changes appear to improve error handling and logging, aligning with best practices for robust application development.  The authorization check remains unchanged, ensuring that only un-authorized policies can be deleted.

### Impact on Clients

The changes are primarily internal and should not directly impact clients.  Improved error handling might indirectly lead to better system stability and fewer disruptions.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

- **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the improved error handling and logging are aligned with the current business requirements and expectations.  Confirm the intent behind commenting out `raise_error` and using `RETURN` instead.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with relevant stakeholders (developers, testers, business analysts) to ensure understanding and agreement.

### Test Thoroughly

- **Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases to cover all scenarios, including successful deletions, deletions of authorized policies, and error handling.  Focus on testing the new error message concatenation and the altered exception handling behavior.

- **Validate Outcomes:** Verify that the error messages are informative and helpful for debugging.  Ensure that the new exception handling mechanism behaves as expected.

### Merge Strategy

- **Conditional Merge:** A conditional merge approach might be suitable, allowing for a phased rollout or rollback if necessary.

- **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  Ensure that the changes do not break existing functionality.

### Update Documentation

Update the procedure's documentation to reflect the changes in error handling and logging.

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Consistent Exception Handling:** Standardize exception handling across the entire package to ensure consistency.

- **Clean Up Code:** Remove any unnecessary comments or variables.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and documentation updates.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes and investigate the reasons for the discrepancies.

- **If Uncertain:** Conduct further analysis and testing to clarify the impact of the changes before merging.


## Additional Considerations

- **Database Integrity:** The changes should not affect database integrity, provided the `del_risk_details` procedure maintains data integrity.

- **Performance Impact:** The changes are unlikely to have a significant performance impact.

- **Error Messages:** The improved error messages should enhance troubleshooting and debugging.


## Conclusion

The changes to `del_pol_dtls_proc` primarily focus on improving error handling and logging.  The improved error messages and more informative exception handling will enhance the procedure's robustness and maintainability.  A thorough review of the business requirements, stakeholder consultation, and comprehensive testing are crucial before merging the NEW_GEMINIA version.  The change in exception handling, specifically the removal of `raise_error` and the use of `RETURN`, requires careful consideration and testing to ensure it aligns with the overall error handling strategy of the application.
