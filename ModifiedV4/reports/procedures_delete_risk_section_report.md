# PL/SQL Procedure `delete_risk_section` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the `delete_risk_section` procedure between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

- **HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic was structured with nested `IF` statements, first checking `v_pol_binder` and then, if it was 'Y', checking `v_bindr_del_allowed`.  The deletion logic was nested within the outer `IF` statement.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The conditional logic is restructured using a more readable and efficient combined `IF` condition.  The logic for handling binder policies is more concisely expressed. The `OR` condition clearly shows the two scenarios under which deletion proceeds.


### Modification of WHERE Clauses

- **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed or added within the `WHERE` clauses of the `DELETE` statements. The `WHERE` clauses remain consistent in both versions, targeting records based on `pmfil_pil_code` and `pil_code` respectively.


### Exception Handling Adjustments

- **HERITAGE Version:** Exception handling was implemented using a `BEGIN...EXCEPTION...END` block within the procedure to handle potential errors during the retrieval of `pol_binder_policy`.  A generic `WHEN OTHERS` clause raised a custom error message.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The exception handling remains largely the same, with a `BEGIN...EXCEPTION...END` block handling potential errors during the retrieval of `pol_binder_policy`. The error handling is consistent with the HERITAGE version.


### Formatting and Indentation

- The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, enhancing code readability.  Parameter declarations are spread across multiple lines for better clarity.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

- **Priority Shift:**  The HERITAGE version implicitly prioritized the check for binder policies (`v_pol_binder`) before considering whether binder section deletion was allowed (`v_bindr_del_allowed`). The NEW_GEMINIA version maintains the same logic but expresses it more clearly.

- **Potential Outcome Difference:** The core logic of deleting risk sections remains unchanged. The restructuring in NEW_GEMINIA improves readability and maintainability without altering the functional behavior.


### Business Rule Alignment

The changes do not appear to alter the underlying business rules governing the deletion of risk sections.  The logic for handling binder policies remains consistent.


### Impact on Clients

The changes are primarily internal to the procedure and should not directly impact clients.  The functionality remains the same.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

- **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the restructuring of the conditional logic in NEW_GEMINIA accurately reflects the intended business rules and does not introduce unintended behavior.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with relevant stakeholders (business analysts, developers, testers) to ensure alignment with business requirements and to address any potential concerns.

### Test Thoroughly

- **Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including cases with and without binder policies, and cases where `v_bindr_del_allowed` is 'Y' and 'N'.

- **Validate Outcomes:**  Rigorously validate that the outcomes of the NEW_GEMINIA version match the HERITAGE version for all test cases.

### Merge Strategy

- **Conditional Merge:**  A direct merge is feasible, given the changes are primarily stylistic and involve restructuring the conditional logic without altering the core functionality.

- **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  Ensure that the merged version maintains backward compatibility.  Thorough testing is crucial to confirm this.

### Update Documentation

Update the procedure's documentation to reflect the changes made to the conditional logic and formatting.

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Consistent Exception Handling:**  Maintain consistent exception handling throughout the package.

- **Clean Up Code:**  Apply consistent formatting and indentation standards across the entire package.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and documentation updates.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes and investigate the reasons for the discrepancy between the two versions.

- **If Uncertain:** Conduct further analysis and testing to clarify the impact of the changes before making a decision.


## Additional Considerations

- **Database Integrity:** The changes should not impact database integrity, provided the testing phase confirms the functional equivalence of both versions.

- **Performance Impact:** The performance impact is expected to be negligible, as the changes are primarily structural and do not involve significant algorithmic modifications.

- **Error Messages:** The error messages remain consistent, ensuring clear communication to users in case of errors.


## Conclusion

The changes to the `delete_risk_section` procedure primarily involve restructuring the conditional logic for improved readability and maintainability. The core functionality remains unchanged.  A thorough review of the business requirements, consultation with stakeholders, and rigorous testing are crucial before merging the NEW_GEMINIA version.  The improved formatting and clarity of the NEW_GEMINIA version are beneficial and should be adopted after verification.
