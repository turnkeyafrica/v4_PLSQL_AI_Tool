# PL/SQL Procedure `edit_pol_taxes` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `edit_pol_taxes` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

* **HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version had no explicit conditional logic within the `UPDATE` statement.  The `WHERE` clause simply specified the conditions for updating records.

* **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version also lacks explicit conditional logic in the `UPDATE` statement itself. The logic remains within the `WHERE` clause.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

* **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed or added in the `WHERE` clause. The conditions `ptx_trac_trnt_code = v_trnt_code` and `ptx_pol_batch_no = v_pol_code` remain the same in both versions.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

* **HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version has no explicit exception handling.  Any errors during the `UPDATE` statement would propagate to the calling procedure.

* **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version also lacks explicit exception handling.  Errors during the `UPDATE` will propagate similarly to the HERITAGE version.

### Formatting and Indentation

* The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, making the code more readable.  Parameter lists are broken across multiple lines for better clarity.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

* **Priority Shift:** There is no change in the fee determination logic itself.  The `NVL` function ensures that if input parameters are NULL, the existing values in the database are retained.

* **Potential Outcome Difference:** The changes are primarily cosmetic (formatting) and do not affect the core functionality of the procedure.  The output will be identical for the same input values in both versions.

### Business Rule Alignment

The changes do not appear to alter any underlying business rules. The update logic remains consistent.

### Impact on Clients

The changes are purely internal and should have no impact on clients.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

* **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the formatting changes in the NEW_GEMINIA version are intentional and align with coding standards.

### Consult Stakeholders

Consult with developers and other stakeholders to confirm the intent behind the formatting changes and to ensure that no unintended consequences exist.

### Test Thoroughly

* **Create Test Cases:** Create comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including NULL and non-NULL values for all input parameters.

* **Validate Outcomes:**  Compare the results of the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions for identical input data to ensure functional equivalence.

### Merge Strategy

* **Conditional Merge:** A simple merge of the NEW_GEMINIA version is recommended, given the lack of functional changes.

* **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  Backward compatibility is maintained as the core functionality remains unchanged.

### Update Documentation

Update the procedure's documentation to reflect the formatting changes and to clarify any potential ambiguities.

### Code Quality Improvements

* **Consistent Exception Handling:**  Add robust exception handling to both versions to gracefully handle potential errors (e.g., `DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX`, `ORA-00001`).

* **Clean Up Code:**  Ensure consistent formatting and indentation across the entire package.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

### If the Change Aligns with Business Goals (which it appears to):

Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and documentation updates.

### If the Change Does Not Align:

Revert the formatting changes if they do not meet coding standards or if they introduce unintended consequences.

### If Uncertain:

Conduct further investigation to clarify the rationale behind the formatting changes and perform rigorous testing before merging.


## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

The changes do not pose any immediate threat to database integrity. However, adding exception handling will improve robustness.

### Performance Impact

The changes are unlikely to have a significant performance impact.

### Error Messages

The lack of exception handling means that generic Oracle error messages will be returned, which may not be user-friendly.  Adding custom exception handling will improve error reporting.


## Conclusion

The primary difference between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions of `edit_pol_taxes` is improved formatting and indentation.  The core functionality remains unchanged.  Merging the NEW_GEMINIA version is recommended after adding comprehensive exception handling and thorough testing to ensure the code's robustness and readability.  The improved formatting enhances maintainability and readability without altering the procedure's behavior.
