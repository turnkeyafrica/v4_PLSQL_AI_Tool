# PL/SQL Function `merge_policies_text` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL function `merge_policies_text` between the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` versions.


## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

* **HERITAGE Version:** The `HERITAGE` version does not contain any explicit conditional logic within the `merge_policies_text` function itself.  The conditional logic is likely handled within the called function `tqc_memo_web_pkg.process_gis_pol_memo`.

* **NEW_GEMINIA Version:**  No change in conditional logic is apparent in this simplified diff. The core logic remains the same.


### Modification of WHERE Clauses

* **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** There are no `WHERE` clauses present in this function. The filtering, if any, occurs within the called function `tqc_memo_web_pkg.process_gis_pol_memo`.


### Exception Handling Adjustments

* **HERITAGE Version:** The `HERITAGE` version lacks explicit exception handling within the `merge_policies_text` function. Any exceptions raised by `tqc_memo_web_pkg.process_gis_pol_memo` would propagate upwards.

* **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** Similarly, the `NEW_GEMINIA` version also lacks explicit exception handling.  The potential for unhandled exceptions remains.


### Formatting and Indentation

* The `NEW_GEMINIA` version shows improved formatting and indentation, making the code more readable.  The parameter list is broken across multiple lines for better clarity.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

* **Priority Shift:**  The core logic of merging policy text remains unchanged.  The fee determination, if any, is handled within the `tqc_memo_web_pkg.process_gis_pol_memo` function, which is not shown in the diff.

* **Potential Outcome Difference:** Based solely on this diff, no direct impact on fee determination is expected. However, changes within the called function (`tqc_memo_web_pkg.process_gis_pol_memo`) could indirectly affect fee calculations.


### Business Rule Alignment

The changes primarily focus on code formatting and readability.  There's no apparent alteration to the underlying business rules implemented by the function.  However, a thorough review of `tqc_memo_web_pkg.process_gis_pol_memo` is necessary to confirm this.


### Impact on Clients

The changes are unlikely to have a direct impact on clients unless the called function (`tqc_memo_web_pkg.process_gis_pol_memo`) has undergone modifications that affect the output.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

* **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the formatting changes align with coding standards and do not unintentionally alter the function's behavior.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with relevant stakeholders (developers, business analysts, testers) to ensure everyone understands the intent and potential impact.

### Test Thoroughly

* **Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases to cover all scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions.  Pay close attention to the output of `tqc_memo_web_pkg.process_gis_pol_memo`.

* **Validate Outcomes:** Compare the results of the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` versions to ensure functional equivalence.


### Merge Strategy

* **Conditional Merge:** A simple merge is likely sufficient, given the minor nature of the changes.

* **Maintain Backward Compatibility:** Ensure that the merged version maintains backward compatibility with existing systems and data.


### Update Documentation

Update the function's documentation to reflect the changes made, including the improved formatting and any modifications to the called function.


### Code Quality Improvements

* **Consistent Exception Handling:** Add comprehensive exception handling to both the `merge_policies_text` function and the called function to improve robustness.

* **Clean Up Code:**  The improved formatting in the `NEW_GEMINIA` version should be adopted.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

* **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the `NEW_GEMINIA` version after thorough testing and documentation updates.

* **If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes and investigate the reasons for the discrepancy.

* **If Uncertain:** Conduct further investigation, including a review of the `tqc_memo_web_pkg.process_gis_pol_memo` function, before making a decision.


## Additional Considerations

* **Database Integrity:** The changes are unlikely to affect database integrity, provided the called function remains unchanged in its data access logic.

* **Performance Impact:** The performance impact is expected to be negligible, given the minor nature of the changes.

* **Error Messages:**  Enhance error messages to provide more context and aid in debugging.


## Conclusion

The changes to the `merge_policies_text` function are primarily cosmetic (improved formatting) and do not appear to alter the core functionality. However, a thorough review of the called function (`tqc_memo_web_pkg.process_gis_pol_memo`) and comprehensive testing are crucial before merging the `NEW_GEMINIA` version into production.  Adding robust exception handling is strongly recommended.
