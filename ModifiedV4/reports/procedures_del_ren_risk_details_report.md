# PL/SQL Procedure `del_ren_risk_details` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `del_ren_risk_details` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

**HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version lacked explicit exception handling and performed a series of DELETE statements sequentially.  If an error occurred during any DELETE operation, the procedure would likely terminate prematurely without providing any indication of the failure point.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version significantly improves error handling by wrapping each DELETE statement within its own `BEGIN...EXCEPTION...END` block. This ensures that if one DELETE operation fails, the others will still be attempted.  An `OUT` parameter `v_error` is added to provide feedback on any errors encountered.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

No changes were made to the `WHERE` clauses themselves.  The conditions remain consistent across both versions.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

**HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version had no exception handling.  Any error during the DELETE operations would lead to immediate procedure termination.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version incorporates comprehensive exception handling for each DELETE statement.  This allows the procedure to continue attempting subsequent DELETEs even if one fails, improving robustness.  An `OUT` parameter `v_error` is used to report errors.

### Formatting and Indentation

The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, enhancing readability and maintainability.  Parameter declarations are more clearly formatted, and the code is better structured.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

The changes do not directly affect fee determination logic.  The procedure focuses solely on deleting records; it does not calculate or modify fees.

### Business Rule Alignment

The changes align better with robust error handling and data integrity business rules.  The previous version's lack of exception handling could have led to partial data deletion and inconsistencies.

### Impact on Clients

The improved error handling in the NEW_GEMINIA version reduces the risk of data inconsistencies and improves the reliability of the process.  Clients will experience more stable and predictable system behavior.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

**Confirm Intent:** Verify that the enhanced exception handling and the `v_error` output parameter align with the current business requirements.  Confirm whether the need to attempt all DELETE operations, even if some fail, is a desired behavior.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with relevant stakeholders (business analysts, database administrators, testers) to ensure the modifications meet expectations and do not introduce unintended consequences.

### Test Thoroughly

**Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases to cover various scenarios, including successful deletions, individual DELETE failures, and multiple DELETE failures.  Test cases should verify the accuracy of the `v_error` output.

**Validate Outcomes:**  Validate that the procedure behaves as expected under all test conditions, ensuring data integrity and consistent error reporting.

### Merge Strategy

**Conditional Merge:**  A conditional merge is recommended.  First, thoroughly test the NEW_GEMINIA version. Then, merge it into the HERITAGE version, ensuring all tests pass.

**Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  If backward compatibility is crucial, consider creating a new procedure with the improved error handling instead of directly replacing the HERITAGE version.  This allows for a phased transition and minimizes disruption.

### Update Documentation

Update the procedure's documentation to reflect the changes in exception handling, the addition of the `v_error` parameter, and the improved robustness.

### Code Quality Improvements

**Consistent Exception Handling:**  Maintain consistent exception handling throughout the package.  All procedures should follow the improved error handling pattern implemented in the NEW_GEMINIA version.

**Clean Up Code:**  Apply consistent formatting and indentation to all procedures within the package to improve readability and maintainability.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

**If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:**  Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and documentation updates.

**If the Change Does Not Align:**  Revert the changes and investigate the reason for the discrepancy between the intended behavior and the implemented changes.

**If Uncertain:**  Conduct further analysis and discussions with stakeholders to clarify the requirements and resolve any ambiguities before proceeding with the merge.


## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

The improved exception handling in the NEW_GEMINIA version enhances database integrity by preventing partial deletions and ensuring atomicity to a greater extent.

### Performance Impact

The added exception handling might slightly impact performance, but the improvement in reliability and data integrity outweighs this minor performance overhead.

### Error Messages

The `v_error` parameter provides more informative error messages, improving troubleshooting and debugging.


## Conclusion

The changes in the `del_ren_risk_details` procedure significantly improve its robustness and reliability by adding comprehensive exception handling.  The improved error reporting mechanism enhances maintainability and troubleshooting.  A thorough testing phase is crucial before merging the changes into production to ensure data integrity and system stability.  The overall impact is positive, leading to a more robust and reliable system.
