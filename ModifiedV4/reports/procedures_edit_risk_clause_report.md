# PL/SQL Procedure `edit_risk_clause` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the `edit_risk_clause` procedure between the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

* **HERITAGE Version:** The `WHERE` clause conditions (`pocl_sbcl_cls_code = v_pocl_code AND pocl_ipu_code = v_ipu_code`) were on separate lines, with extra spacing.

* **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The `WHERE` clause conditions are now on a single line, improving readability.  The logic itself remains unchanged.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

* **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed or added. The only change is formatting.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

* **HERITAGE Version:** No explicit exception handling was present.

* **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** No explicit exception handling was added.  The lack of exception handling remains a concern.

### Formatting and Indentation

* The procedure declaration and `UPDATE` statement formatting have been slightly altered. The `NEW_GEMINIA` version uses a more compact style.  Parameter list formatting has changed from multi-line to single-line.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

* **Priority Shift:** There is no change to the core logic of updating the `gin_policy_clauses` table.  The `WHERE` clause remains the same, ensuring only the specified record is updated.

* **Potential Outcome Difference:** No functional difference is expected. The changes are purely cosmetic.

### Business Rule Alignment

The changes do not affect the underlying business rules. The procedure continues to update a specific policy clause based on provided codes.

### Impact on Clients

The changes are purely internal and should have no impact on clients.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

* **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the formatting changes align with coding standards and readability goals.  The lack of exception handling should be addressed.

### Consult Stakeholders

Consult the development team to confirm the intent behind the formatting changes and the absence of exception handling.

### Test Thoroughly

* **Create Test Cases:** Create unit tests to verify that the procedure functions correctly with various inputs, including edge cases and boundary conditions.  Pay special attention to the `WHERE` clause to ensure correct record selection.

* **Validate Outcomes:**  Compare the results of the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` versions with a comprehensive test suite to ensure no unintended consequences.

### Merge Strategy

* **Conditional Merge:** A simple merge is acceptable, provided the lack of exception handling is addressed.

* **Maintain Backward Compatibility:** The changes are backward compatible.

### Update Documentation

Update the package documentation to reflect the formatting changes.

### Code Quality Improvements

* **Consistent Exception Handling:** Add exception handling to gracefully manage potential errors (e.g., `NO_DATA_FOUND`, `OTHERS`).  Log errors appropriately.

* **Clean Up Code:**  While the formatting changes are minor, consider adopting a consistent coding style across the entire package.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

### If the Change Aligns with Business Goals (Cosmetic Changes Only):

Merge the changes after addressing the lack of exception handling and updating documentation.

### If the Change Does Not Align:

Revert the changes if the formatting changes are not deemed necessary or if they introduce inconsistencies.

### If Uncertain:

Conduct further investigation to clarify the intent behind the changes and consult with stakeholders before merging.


## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

The changes do not pose a risk to database integrity, provided the `WHERE` clause remains accurate.

### Performance Impact

The performance impact is negligible.

### Error Messages

The absence of error handling is a significant concern.  Appropriate error messages should be implemented to provide informative feedback to calling procedures or applications.


## Conclusion

The changes between the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` versions of `edit_risk_clause` are primarily cosmetic, focusing on formatting and indentation.  However, the lack of exception handling is a critical issue that needs immediate attention.  Before merging, it is crucial to address this deficiency, implement comprehensive testing, and update the documentation.  The merge should proceed only after these steps are completed.
