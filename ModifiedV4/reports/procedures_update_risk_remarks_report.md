# PL/SQL Procedure `update_risk_remarks` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `update_risk_remarks` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

* **HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic (`IF-ELSIF-ELSE`) was spread across multiple lines, making it slightly less readable.  The exception handling was nested within each conditional block.

* **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The code has been reformatted to improve readability. Each `IF`, `ELSIF`, and `ELSE` block is clearly separated and aligned, enhancing maintainability. The exception handling remains consistent across all branches.


### Modification of WHERE Clauses

* **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed or added in the `WHERE` clauses. The `WHERE` clause remains consistent: `WHERE polrs_code = v_polrs_code` for update and delete operations.


### Exception Handling Adjustments

* **HERITAGE Version:** Exception handling was implemented within each conditional block (`IF`, `ELSIF`, `ELSE`).  The error message was the same for all exceptions.

* **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** Exception handling remains consistent across all conditional branches. The error messages are also consistent, improving code clarity and maintainability.


### Formatting and Indentation

* The NEW_GEMINIA version shows significant improvements in formatting and indentation. The code is more structured and easier to read, improving overall code quality.  The parameter list in the procedure header is also formatted more consistently.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

* **Priority Shift:** There is no change in the core logic of fee determination. The procedure does not directly handle fees; it manages risk remarks.

* **Potential Outcome Difference:** The changes are purely cosmetic and related to code formatting and structure.  There should be no difference in the functional outcome.


### Business Rule Alignment

The changes do not affect the underlying business rules. The procedure continues to perform the same actions (insert, update, delete) based on the input `v_action` parameter.


### Impact on Clients

The changes are purely internal to the database procedure and should have no impact on clients.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

* **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the formatting changes align with coding standards and best practices.  The functional logic remains unchanged.

### Consult Stakeholders

Consult with developers and other stakeholders to review the changes and ensure everyone agrees with the improved formatting and structure.


### Test Thoroughly

* **Create Test Cases:** Create comprehensive test cases covering all three actions ('A', 'E', 'D') to ensure the functionality remains unchanged after the merge.  Include edge cases and error conditions.

* **Validate Outcomes:**  Verify that the output and database state are identical before and after the merge for all test cases.


### Merge Strategy

* **Conditional Merge:** A simple merge should suffice, as the changes are primarily cosmetic.  Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage the merge.

* **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  The functional behavior is unchanged, so backward compatibility is maintained.


### Update Documentation

Update the procedure's documentation to reflect the improved formatting and any changes to error handling messages (though the messages themselves are largely unchanged).


### Code Quality Improvements

* **Consistent Exception Handling:** The consistent exception handling in the NEW_GEMINIA version is a significant improvement.

* **Clean Up Code:** The improved formatting and indentation significantly enhance code readability and maintainability.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

### If the Change Aligns with Business Goals (which it does, assuming improved code readability is a goal):

Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version directly.


### If the Change Does Not Align:

This scenario is unlikely, given that the changes are primarily stylistic improvements.  If there's a concern, revert to the HERITAGE version and discuss the formatting standards.


### If Uncertain:

Conduct thorough testing as described above to verify the functionality remains unchanged.  Then, merge the NEW_GEMINIA version.


## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

The changes do not impact database integrity.  The core database operations remain the same.


### Performance Impact

The performance impact is expected to be negligible, as the changes are primarily cosmetic.


### Error Messages

The error messages are largely unchanged, but their consistency is improved in the NEW_GEMINIA version.


## Conclusion

The changes in the `update_risk_remarks` procedure are primarily focused on improving code readability, formatting, and consistency in exception handling.  The core functionality remains unchanged.  After thorough testing, the NEW_GEMINIA version should be merged, as it represents a significant improvement in code quality without altering the procedure's behavior.
