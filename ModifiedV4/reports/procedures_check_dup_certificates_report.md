# PL/SQL Procedure `check_dup_certificates` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `check_dup_certificates` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.  The HERITAGE version appears to be fully functional while the NEW_GEMINIA version is completely commented out.  The analysis will focus on the differences *if* the NEW_GEMINIA version were to be uncommented and functional.


## Summary of Key Changes:

The diff shows that the entire procedure `check_dup_certificates` has been commented out in the NEW_GEMINIA version.  Therefore, a direct comparison of logic is not possible without uncommenting the NEW_GEMINIA code.  However, based on the structure of the commented-out code, we can infer some potential changes:

- **Reordering of Conditional Logic:**  The HERITAGE version has a clear sequential check for duplicate certificates, first checking `gin_policy_certs` and then `gin_aki_policy_cert_dtls`. The NEW_GEMINIA version (if uncommented) would likely maintain this order, but the exact logic within each check might have changed (see below).

    - **HERITAGE Version:** Checks for duplicate certificates in `gin_policy_certs` first, then in `gin_aki_policy_cert_dtls`.  The order implies a priority to standard certificates over digital certificates.

    - **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** (Inferred)  The order would likely remain the same, but the specific conditions within each `SELECT COUNT(*)` statement might be altered.

- **Modification of WHERE Clauses:**  The `WHERE` clauses in both `SELECT COUNT(*)` statements in the HERITAGE version might have been modified in the NEW_GEMINIA version (if uncommented).  Without the uncommented code, specific changes cannot be identified.

    - **Removal and Addition of Conditions:**  Potential additions or removals of conditions within the `WHERE` clauses could significantly alter the procedure's behavior.  This requires examination of the uncommented NEW_GEMINIA code.

- **Exception Handling Adjustments:**  The exception handling remains largely the same in both versions (if the NEW_GEMINIA version were uncommented).  Both versions handle `OTHERS` exceptions by setting `v_dummy` to 0.

    - **HERITAGE Version:**  Basic `WHEN OTHERS` exception handling for both `SELECT` statements.

    - **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** (Inferred)  Similar basic `WHEN OTHERS` exception handling, but the specific error handling might be improved or changed in the uncommented code.

- **Formatting and Indentation:**  The formatting and indentation appear consistent in both versions (if the NEW_GEMINIA version were uncommented).  However, this is a minor change.


## Implications of the Changes:

- **Logic Alteration in Fee Determination:**  The procedure doesn't directly calculate fees, but the changes to the duplicate certificate checks could indirectly impact fee calculations in other parts of the application.  The changes might alter which certificates are considered duplicates, leading to different outcomes.

    - **Priority Shift:**  The HERITAGE version prioritizes checking standard certificates before digital certificates.  The NEW_GEMINIA version (if uncommented) might change this priority or introduce new criteria.

    - **Potential Outcome Difference:**  Depending on the changes in the `WHERE` clauses, the procedure might now allow certificates that were previously considered duplicates, or vice-versa.  This could lead to incorrect fee calculations or other downstream issues.

- **Business Rule Alignment:**  The changes might reflect updates to business rules regarding duplicate certificate handling.  The exact nature of the changes requires analysis of the uncommented NEW_GEMINIA code.

- **Impact on Clients:**  The changes could lead to different outcomes for clients when creating or modifying certificates.  This could result in unexpected behavior or errors if not properly tested and communicated.


## Recommendations for Merging:

- **Review Business Requirements:**
    - **Confirm Intent:**  The primary step is to understand *why* the procedure was commented out.  Was it a temporary measure, or a deliberate decision to remove the functionality?  If the functionality is needed, the NEW_GEMINIA version must be uncommented and reviewed.

- **Consult Stakeholders:**  Discuss the changes with business analysts and other stakeholders to ensure the changes align with business requirements and expectations.

- **Test Thoroughly:**
    - **Create Test Cases:**  Develop comprehensive test cases to cover all scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions.  Pay close attention to the conditions in the `WHERE` clauses.
    - **Validate Outcomes:**  Carefully compare the results of the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions (after uncommenting) to identify any discrepancies.

- **Merge Strategy:**
    - **Conditional Merge:**  If the NEW_GEMINIA version is intended to replace the HERITAGE version, a direct replacement is possible after thorough testing.  If both versions are needed, consider creating a new procedure with a more descriptive name.
    - **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  If the HERITAGE version needs to be retained, consider creating a new procedure or modifying the existing one to handle both scenarios.

- **Update Documentation:**  Update the procedure's documentation to reflect the changes made and their implications.

- **Code Quality Improvements:**
    - **Consistent Exception Handling:**  Ensure consistent exception handling throughout the procedure.  Consider using more specific exception types instead of `WHEN OTHERS`.
    - **Clean Up Code:**  Review the code for any unnecessary complexity or redundancy.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis:

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:**  Uncomment the NEW_GEMINIA code, thoroughly test it, update documentation, and merge it into the production environment.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:**  Revert the changes, investigate the reasons for the discrepancy, and address the underlying issues.

- **If Uncertain:**  Conduct further investigation to clarify the intent of the changes and their impact on the system.


## Additional Considerations:

- **Database Integrity:**  The changes could potentially affect database integrity if not properly tested.  Ensure that the changes do not introduce data inconsistencies or errors.

- **Performance Impact:**  The changes to the `WHERE` clauses might affect the performance of the procedure.  Benchmark the performance of both versions to identify any significant differences.

- **Error Messages:**  Review and improve the error messages to provide more informative feedback to users.


## Conclusion:

The analysis reveals a significant change in the `check_dup_certificates` procedure.  The NEW_GEMINIA version is currently commented out, preventing a direct comparison.  However, based on the structure of the commented-out code, there are potential modifications to the conditional logic and `WHERE` clauses that could significantly alter the procedure's behavior.  Before merging any changes, a thorough review of business requirements, comprehensive testing, and consultation with stakeholders are crucial to ensure the integrity and functionality of the system.  The primary action is to understand why the NEW_GEMINIA version was commented out and proceed accordingly.
