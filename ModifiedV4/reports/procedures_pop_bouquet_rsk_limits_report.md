# PL/SQL Procedure `pop_bouquet_rsk_limits` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `pop_bouquet_rsk_limits` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.


## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

**HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic was structured as a series of independent `IF` statements, each checking a specific condition related to `sect_type` and other input parameters (`v_garage_applic`, `v_no_claim_hist`, `v_usage_type`, `v_vehicle_size`).  The order of these `IF` statements determined the processing priority.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The conditional logic has been restructured using a series of nested `IF` statements. This change significantly alters the order of evaluation and potentially the outcome.  The logic is now more organized and readable, grouping conditions based on `sect_type` and then further refining based on other input parameters.


### Modification of WHERE Clauses

**Removal and Addition of Conditions:** The `WHERE` clause of the `pil_cur` cursor in the HERITAGE version contained a commented-out range condition (`--AND NVL(v_range,0) BETWEEN NVL(prr_range_from,0) AND NVL(prr_range_to,0)`). This condition has been removed in the NEW_GEMINIA version.  Additionally, the NEW_GEMINIA version includes a significantly expanded cursor definition, seemingly adding conditions related to `v_range`, `v_garage_applic`, `v_no_claim_hist`, `v_usage_type`, and `v_vehicle_size` within the `UNION` statements (though these `UNION` statements are commented out in both versions).  The impact of these changes on data retrieval needs careful examination.


### Exception Handling Adjustments

**HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version uses a single `WHEN OTHERS` exception handler within each `IF` block to catch any errors during the `INSERT` statements.  Error messages are generic.

**NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version maintains the same basic exception handling structure, but with improved formatting and consistency.  The error messages remain generic.


### Formatting and Indentation

The NEW_GEMINIA version shows significant improvements in formatting and indentation, making the code much more readable and maintainable.  The HERITAGE version is less readable due to inconsistent formatting and lack of proper indentation.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

**Priority Shift:**

* **HERITAGE:** The order of the `IF` statements determined which conditions were checked first. If multiple conditions were met, the order of execution could have influenced the final result.
* **NEW_GEMINIA:** The nested `IF` structure introduces a different evaluation order.  The conditions are now grouped and evaluated in a more structured manner, but this could lead to different outcomes compared to the HERITAGE version if the order of conditions mattered in the original logic.

**Potential Outcome Difference:** The reordering of conditional logic and the changes in the `WHERE` clause could lead to different sets of premium rates being applied, resulting in different premium calculations for policies. This is a critical concern requiring thorough testing.


### Business Rule Alignment

The changes might reflect an update to the business rules governing premium calculation.  It's crucial to verify if the NEW_GEMINIA version accurately reflects the current business requirements.  The commented-out `UNION` statements suggest an attempt to incorporate additional logic, which needs to be reviewed and potentially implemented.


### Impact on Clients

The changes in premium calculation could directly impact clients' premiums.  A thorough regression test is necessary to ensure that the changes do not lead to unexpected or incorrect premium charges.  Clients might experience either higher or lower premiums depending on the nature of the changes.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

**Confirm Intent:**  Carefully review the business requirements to understand the intended changes in premium calculation logic.  Determine if the changes in the `WHERE` clause and the conditional logic accurately reflect these requirements.  The commented-out parts of the cursor should be reviewed to determine if they were intentionally removed or if they represent unfinished work.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with business stakeholders (e.g., actuaries, underwriters, product managers) to ensure that the NEW_GEMINIA version correctly implements the desired business rules and that the removal of the range condition is intentional.

### Test Thoroughly

**Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions, to validate the accuracy of premium calculations in the NEW_GEMINIA version.  Pay close attention to the impact of the changes on different policy types and customer profiles.

**Validate Outcomes:** Compare the premium calculations from the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions for a representative sample of policies to identify any discrepancies.  Investigate and resolve any differences.

### Merge Strategy

**Conditional Merge:**  A conditional merge approach is recommended.  Thoroughly test the NEW_GEMINIA version in a non-production environment.  Once validated, deploy it to production.

**Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  Consider maintaining backward compatibility if possible, perhaps by creating a new procedure with a different name for the NEW_GEMINIA logic, allowing for a phased rollout.

### Update Documentation

Update the package documentation to reflect the changes made to the procedure, including the rationale behind the changes and any potential impact on clients.

### Code Quality Improvements

**Consistent Exception Handling:**  While the exception handling is improved in the NEW_GEMINIA version, consider implementing more specific exception handling to provide more informative error messages.

**Clean Up Code:**  Remove the commented-out code from the `UNION` statements in the cursor definition.  If the code is not needed, it should be removed to improve code clarity.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

**If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:**  After thorough testing and stakeholder approval, merge the NEW_GEMINIA version, updating documentation accordingly.

**If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes and investigate the reason for the discrepancy between the intended business rules and the implemented logic.

**If Uncertain:** Conduct further analysis and testing to clarify the intent of the changes.  Consult with stakeholders to resolve any ambiguities.


## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

Ensure that the changes do not compromise database integrity.  Test thoroughly to prevent data corruption or inconsistencies.

### Performance Impact

Assess the performance impact of the changes, particularly the changes to the `WHERE` clause and the addition of nested `IF` statements.  Optimize the code if necessary to maintain acceptable performance levels.

### Error Messages

Improve the error messages to provide more specific information about the nature of the error, aiding in debugging and troubleshooting.


## Conclusion

The changes to the `pop_bouquet_rsk_limits` procedure introduce significant alterations to the premium calculation logic.  While the code formatting and structure are improved, the potential for different premium outcomes necessitates a thorough review of business requirements, consultation with stakeholders, and rigorous testing before merging into production.  A phased rollout approach, maintaining backward compatibility, is strongly recommended to minimize risk.  The commented-out code needs clarification and either implementation or removal.  Finally, enhancing error messages will improve maintainability and debugging.
