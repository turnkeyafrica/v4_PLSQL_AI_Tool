# PL/SQL Procedure `del_pol_clause` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the `del_pol_clause` procedure between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes:

### Reordering of Conditional Logic:

- **HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic was structured with nested `IF` statements, checking for mandatory clauses and then handling the deletion based on the result.  The exception handling was less structured and potentially less robust.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The conditional logic is restructured with a primary `IF` statement checking the parameter `v_del_mand_clauses` to allow deletion of mandatory clauses.  This is followed by another nested `IF` statement to handle the deletion process based on the presence of mandatory clauses.  This improves readability and potentially simplifies the logic.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses:

- **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** The NEW_GEMINIA version removed a `SELECT` statement that counted mandatory clauses from the `gin_scl_cvt_mand_clauses` table. This suggests a simplification or change in the business rules related to mandatory clauses.  The remaining `SELECT` statement now only queries `gin_subcl_clauses`.

### Exception Handling Adjustments:

- **HERITAGE Version:** The HERITAGE version had a less structured exception handling block, potentially leading to less precise error handling.  The `raise_when_others` function is used without specific error codes.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The NEW_GEMINIA version maintains the same basic exception handling structure, but the commented-out `EXCEPTION` block within the nested `IF` statement suggests a potential simplification or refactoring of error handling.  The use of `raise_when_others` remains, but the potential for more specific error handling is present.

### Formatting and Indentation:

- The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, enhancing readability and maintainability.  Variable names are also more consistently formatted.


## Implications of the Changes:

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination:

- **Priority Shift:** The HERITAGE version seemingly prioritized checking for mandatory clauses from two tables (`gin_subcl_clauses` and `gin_scl_cvt_mand_clauses`). The NEW_GEMINIA version prioritizes a configuration parameter (`DEL_MANDATORY_CLAUSE`) to determine whether mandatory clauses can be deleted, and then checks only one table (`gin_subcl_clauses`).

- **Potential Outcome Difference:** The removal of the `gin_scl_cvt_mand_clauses` check could lead to different outcomes if there are mandatory clauses defined only in that table. This needs thorough investigation and testing.

### Business Rule Alignment:

The changes suggest a potential shift in the business rules governing the deletion of policy clauses.  The introduction of the `DEL_MANDATORY_CLAUSE` parameter allows for more flexible control over the deletion process.  The exact implications depend on the value of this parameter and the data in the affected tables.

### Impact on Clients:

The changes could impact clients if the business rules regarding mandatory clause deletion have changed.  This could lead to unexpected behavior if not properly communicated and tested.


## Recommendations for Merging:

### Review Business Requirements:

- **Confirm Intent:**  Thoroughly review the business requirements to understand the rationale behind the changes, particularly the removal of the `gin_scl_cvt_mand_clauses` table check and the introduction of the `DEL_MANDATORY_CLAUSE` parameter.

### Consult Stakeholders:

Engage with business stakeholders to confirm the intended behavior of the NEW_GEMINIA version and to assess the potential impact on clients.

### Test Thoroughly:

- **Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including the presence and absence of mandatory clauses in both tables (`gin_subcl_clauses` and the removed `gin_scl_cvt_mand_clauses`), and different values for the `DEL_MANDATORY_CLAUSE` parameter.

- **Validate Outcomes:**  Carefully validate the outcomes of the test cases to ensure they align with the revised business requirements.

### Merge Strategy:

- **Conditional Merge:**  A conditional merge strategy should be adopted, carefully considering the implications of the changes.  The removal of the `gin_scl_cvt_mand_clauses` check needs careful consideration.

- **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  If possible, maintain backward compatibility by adding a check for the old logic or providing a mechanism to switch between the old and new logic during a transition period.

### Update Documentation:

Update the procedure's documentation to reflect the changes in logic, exception handling, and business rules.

### Code Quality Improvements:

- **Consistent Exception Handling:**  Implement more specific exception handling using named exceptions instead of relying solely on `WHEN OTHERS`.

- **Clean Up Code:**  Remove unnecessary comments and ensure consistent formatting and naming conventions throughout the procedure.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis:

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:**  Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and documentation updates.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:**  Revert the changes and investigate the discrepancy between the intended behavior and the implemented changes.

- **If Uncertain:**  Conduct further analysis and testing to clarify the impact of the changes before making a decision.


## Additional Considerations:

- **Database Integrity:**  Ensure that the changes do not compromise database integrity.  Thorough testing is crucial to prevent data loss or corruption.

- **Performance Impact:**  Assess the performance impact of the changes, particularly the removal of the `gin_scl_cvt_mand_clauses` table check.  Profiling and benchmarking may be necessary.

- **Error Messages:**  Improve the clarity and informativeness of error messages to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.


## Conclusion:

The changes to the `del_pol_clause` procedure introduce significant alterations to the logic and business rules governing the deletion of policy clauses.  A thorough review of the business requirements, comprehensive testing, and careful consideration of the potential impact on clients are essential before merging the NEW_GEMINIA version.  The improved formatting and potential for more robust exception handling are positive aspects of the NEW_GEMINIA version, but the core logic changes require careful scrutiny.  The removal of the `gin_scl_cvt_mand_clauses` table check is a particularly critical aspect that requires a detailed investigation to understand its implications.
