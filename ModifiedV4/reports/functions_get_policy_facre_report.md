## PL/SQL Function `get_policy_facre` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL function `get_policy_facre` between the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` versions.

**Summary of Key Changes:**

- **Reordering of Conditional Logic:**
    - **HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic (checking for `pol_policy_type = 'F'` and `pol_batch_no = v_batch_no`) is implicitly embedded within the `SELECT COUNT(1)` statement.  There is no explicit conditional logic outside the SQL statement.
    - **NEW_GEMINIA Version:**  The structure remains largely the same; the conditional logic is still implicitly within the `SELECT` statement.  The only difference is the addition of parentheses around `v_count` in the `RETURN` statement.

- **Modification of WHERE Clauses:**
    - **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed or added in the `WHERE` clause. The `WHERE` clause remains identical between versions.

- **Exception Handling Adjustments:**
    - **HERITAGE Version:** The exception handling uses `RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR` with a hardcoded error message and error number. The formatting is less consistent.
    - **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The exception handling is improved with better formatting and indentation, making the code more readable.  The functionality remains the same.

- **Formatting and Indentation:**
    - The `NEW_GEMINIA` version shows improved formatting and indentation, enhancing readability and maintainability.  The use of more whitespace and consistent indentation improves code clarity.


**Implications of the Changes:**

- **Logic Alteration in Fee Determination:**
    - **Priority Shift:** There is no change in the core logic of fee determination. The function simply counts policies matching specific criteria.
    - **Potential Outcome Difference:** The changes are purely cosmetic (formatting and minor syntax) and should not affect the functional outcome.  The addition of parentheses around `v_count` in the `RETURN` statement is redundant as `UPPER` function operates on a single numeric argument.

- **Business Rule Alignment:** The changes do not appear to alter any underlying business rules.

- **Impact on Clients:** The changes are internal and should have no direct impact on clients.


**Recommendations for Merging:**

- **Review Business Requirements:**
    - **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the formatting changes align with coding standards. The redundant parentheses in the `RETURN` statement should be removed.

- **Consult Stakeholders:**  While not strictly necessary for such minor changes, a brief discussion with developers familiar with the codebase is recommended to ensure everyone agrees on the improved formatting.

- **Test Thoroughly:**
    - **Create Test Cases:** Create unit tests to verify that the function returns the correct count under various scenarios (e.g., zero policies, one policy, multiple policies).
    - **Validate Outcomes:** Compare the results of the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` versions with the same input data to ensure no functional differences.

- **Merge Strategy:**
    - **Conditional Merge:** A simple merge should suffice, given the minor nature of the changes.
    - **Maintain Backward Compatibility:** Backward compatibility is maintained as the core functionality remains unchanged.

- **Update Documentation:** Update the package documentation to reflect the minor formatting changes.

- **Code Quality Improvements:**
    - **Consistent Exception Handling:**  Maintain the improved formatting and indentation of the exception handling block in the `NEW_GEMINIA` version.
    - **Clean Up Code:** Remove the redundant parentheses around `v_count` in the `RETURN` statement.


**Potential Actions Based on Analysis:**

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the `NEW_GEMINIA` version after addressing the redundant parentheses and thorough testing.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:**  Revert the changes if the formatting changes are not desired.  This scenario is unlikely given the improvements in readability.

- **If Uncertain:** Conduct further analysis and testing to clarify any doubts before merging.


**Additional Considerations:**

- **Database Integrity:** The changes should not affect database integrity.

- **Performance Impact:** The changes are unlikely to have a noticeable impact on performance.

- **Error Messages:** The error message remains the same, but its presentation is improved due to better formatting.


**Conclusion:**

The changes between the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` versions of `get_policy_facre` are primarily cosmetic improvements in formatting and indentation.  The core functionality remains unchanged.  After removing the redundant parentheses and thorough testing, the `NEW_GEMINIA` version should be merged due to its improved readability and maintainability.  The improved formatting enhances code quality without impacting functionality or database integrity.
