# PL/SQL Procedure `checkifauthorised` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `checkifauthorised` between the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` versions.


## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

* **HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic (`IF NVL (v_cnt, 0) > 0 THEN ... END IF;`) was spread across multiple lines, with inconsistent indentation.

* **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The conditional logic remains functionally the same but is now more compact and consistently indented, improving readability.


### Modification of WHERE Clauses

* **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed or added in the `WHERE` clause of the `SELECT` statement.  The `WHERE` clause remains identical in both versions.


### Exception Handling Adjustments

* **HERITAGE Version:** The `raise_error` call was spread across multiple lines, impacting readability.

* **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The `raise_error` call is now more compact and uses better string concatenation for improved readability.  The functionality remains unchanged.


### Formatting and Indentation

* The `NEW_GEMINIA` version shows improved formatting and indentation, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.  The `HERITAGE` version has inconsistent indentation.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

* **Priority Shift:** There is no change to the core logic of fee determination; the procedure only checks for un-authorised documents.

* **Potential Outcome Difference:** The changes are purely cosmetic and do not affect the procedure's functionality.  The output (error message) remains the same.


### Business Rule Alignment

The changes do not affect the underlying business rule of checking for un-authorised documents before proceeding.


### Impact on Clients

The changes are purely internal and have no direct impact on clients.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

* **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the sole intent of the changes was to improve code readability and maintainability, and not to alter the underlying functionality.


### Consult Stakeholders

Consult with developers and potentially business analysts to confirm the changes are acceptable and do not introduce unintended consequences.


### Test Thoroughly

* **Create Test Cases:** Create comprehensive test cases to verify that the procedure functions identically in both versions, focusing on the error handling path.  Test cases should cover scenarios with 0, 1, and multiple un-authorised documents.

* **Validate Outcomes:**  Ensure that the error message generated is consistent across both versions.


### Merge Strategy

* **Conditional Merge:** A simple merge is sufficient, as the changes are purely cosmetic and do not affect functionality.

* **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  Backward compatibility is maintained as the core functionality remains unchanged.


### Update Documentation

Update the procedure's documentation to reflect the improved formatting and any changes to error messages (though the error message itself is functionally the same).


### Code Quality Improvements

* **Consistent Exception Handling:** The improved formatting of the `raise_error` call contributes to more consistent exception handling.

* **Clean Up Code:** The improved formatting and indentation significantly improve the code's cleanliness and readability.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

### If the Change Aligns with Business Goals (which it does in this case, as it's purely a code improvement):

Merge the `NEW_GEMINIA` version directly.


### If the Change Does Not Align:

This scenario is unlikely given the nature of the changes.  If there's a concern, revert to the `HERITAGE` version and discuss the changes with the developers who made them.


### If Uncertain:

Perform thorough testing as described above.  If tests pass, merge the `NEW_GEMINIA` version.  If tests fail, investigate the discrepancies and resolve them before merging.


## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

The changes do not affect database integrity.


### Performance Impact

The changes are unlikely to have any noticeable performance impact.


### Error Messages

The error message remains functionally identical; only the formatting within the `raise_error` call has changed.


## Conclusion

The changes to the `checkifauthorised` procedure are primarily cosmetic, improving code readability and maintainability without altering its core functionality.  After thorough testing, the `NEW_GEMINIA` version should be merged.  The improved formatting and consistent indentation enhance code quality and reduce the risk of future errors.
