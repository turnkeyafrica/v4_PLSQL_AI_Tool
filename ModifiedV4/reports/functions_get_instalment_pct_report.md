# PL/SQL Function `get_instalment_pct` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL function `get_instalment_pct` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

* **HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic was spread across multiple nested loops and `IF` statements, making it less readable and potentially harder to maintain.  The error handling was intertwined with the main logic.

* **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The conditional logic has been restructured.  The main `IF` statements checking for null or invalid input parameters are now at the beginning, improving readability and making the error handling more explicit. The loops are more concise and easier to follow.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses (Implicit in Loop Conditions)

* **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** The original code implicitly handled conditions within nested loops. The NEW_GEMINIA version refactors this into more explicit `IF` statements within the loop, improving readability and maintainability.  The condition `INSTR (v_str, ':') = 0 AND i <= v_install_no` is now explicitly handled to raise an error, improving error handling.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

* **HERITAGE Version:** Exception handling was embedded within the main processing loop, making it less organized.

* **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** Exception handling is more structured. The `BEGIN...EXCEPTION...END` block is clearly separated, improving readability and making the code easier to debug.

### Formatting and Indentation

* The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, enhancing readability and maintainability.  The code is more consistently formatted.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

* **Priority Shift:** The HERITAGE version's logic might have had subtle inconsistencies in how it handled edge cases due to the nested structure. The NEW_GEMINIA version prioritizes explicit error handling and input validation at the beginning, making the logic more robust.

* **Potential Outcome Difference:** While the core logic remains the same, the improved structure in NEW_GEMINIA reduces the risk of unexpected behavior in edge cases.  The explicit error handling will provide more informative error messages.

### Business Rule Alignment

The changes do not appear to alter the core business rules. However, the improved clarity and structure of the NEW_GEMINIA version make it easier to verify that the code accurately reflects the intended business rules.

### Impact on Clients

The changes are primarily internal to the application.  Clients should not directly experience any functional changes unless the underlying business rules were unintentionally modified.  However, improved error messages might provide better feedback in case of invalid input.

## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

* **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the changes in the NEW_GEMINIA version accurately reflect the intended business logic and error handling.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with relevant stakeholders (business analysts, testers, etc.) to ensure that the modifications align with their expectations.

### Test Thoroughly

* **Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions, to validate the functionality of both versions and identify any discrepancies.  Pay close attention to the error handling.

* **Validate Outcomes:** Compare the output of the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions for a wide range of inputs to ensure that the changes have not introduced unintended behavior.

### Merge Strategy

* **Conditional Merge:**  A direct merge is likely feasible given the changes are primarily structural and not functional. However, thorough testing is crucial.

* **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  Ensure that the merged version maintains backward compatibility with existing applications that rely on the HERITAGE version.

### Update Documentation

Update the package documentation to reflect the changes made to the function, including any changes to error handling and input validation.

### Code Quality Improvements

* **Consistent Exception Handling:**  Maintain the improved exception handling structure in the merged version.

* **Clean Up Code:**  Apply consistent formatting and indentation throughout the package.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

* **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and documentation updates.

* **If the Change Does Not Align:**  Revert the changes and investigate the reasons for the discrepancy between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

* **If Uncertain:** Conduct further analysis and testing to clarify the intent and impact of the changes before making a decision.


## Additional Considerations

* **Database Integrity:** The changes should not impact database integrity, provided the underlying data structures remain unchanged.

* **Performance Impact:** The performance impact is likely to be minimal, as the changes are primarily structural.  However, performance testing should be conducted to confirm this.

* **Error Messages:** The improved error messages in the NEW_GEMINIA version will enhance the user experience by providing more informative feedback in case of errors.


## Conclusion

The changes to the `get_instalment_pct` function primarily improve code readability, maintainability, and error handling.  The core logic appears unchanged, but the improved structure reduces the risk of unexpected behavior.  A thorough testing phase is crucial before merging the NEW_GEMINIA version to ensure that the changes do not introduce unintended consequences.  The improved error handling and clarity will likely benefit the overall system stability and maintainability.
