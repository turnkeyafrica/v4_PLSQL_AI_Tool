# PL/SQL Function `merge_claims_text` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL function `merge_claims_text` between the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` versions.  The diff shows minimal functional changes, primarily focused on formatting and minor stylistic adjustments.

## Summary of Key Changes

- **Reordering of Conditional Logic:**  There is no conditional logic present in either version of the function.  Both versions directly call the `tqc_memo_web_pkg.process_gis_pol_memo` function.

- **Modification of WHERE Clauses:** This function does not contain any `WHERE` clauses as it's not a query.

- **Exception Handling Adjustments:** Both versions lack explicit exception handling.  The commented-out `RAISE_ERROR` statement suggests an intention to add error handling, but it's not implemented in either version.

- **Formatting and Indentation:** The `NEW_GEMINIA` version exhibits improved formatting and indentation, making the code more readable.  Specifically, the line lengths are shorter, and the indentation is more consistent.


## Implications of the Changes

- **Logic Alteration in Fee Determination:** The core logic of merging claim text remains unchanged.  The function simply passes parameters to another function (`tqc_memo_web_pkg.process_gis_pol_memo`).  Therefore, there's no direct impact on fee determination.

- **Business Rule Alignment:** The changes are purely cosmetic; they don't affect the underlying business rules implemented within `tqc_memo_web_pkg.process_gis_pol_memo`.

- **Impact on Clients:**  No direct impact on clients is expected as the core functionality remains the same.


## Recommendations for Merging

- **Review Business Requirements:**
    - **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the formatting changes are intentional and align with coding standards.  The lack of exception handling should be addressed.

- **Consult Stakeholders:**  While the changes seem minor, it's advisable to consult with stakeholders (developers, testers, business analysts) to confirm the intent behind the changes and the absence of exception handling.

- **Test Thoroughly:**
    - **Create Test Cases:** Create comprehensive test cases covering various input scenarios, including edge cases and potential error conditions, to ensure the function behaves as expected after the merge.
    - **Validate Outcomes:** Compare the outputs of both versions with the test cases to ensure consistency.

- **Merge Strategy:**
    - **Conditional Merge:** A simple direct merge is sufficient, given the minimal changes.
    - **Maintain Backward Compatibility:** Backward compatibility is maintained as the core functionality is unchanged.

- **Update Documentation:** Update the function's documentation to reflect any changes in formatting or style guidelines.

- **Code Quality Improvements:**
    - **Consistent Exception Handling:** Implement robust exception handling to gracefully manage potential errors during the `tqc_memo_web_pkg.process_gis_pol_memo` call.  Consider using a `BEGIN...EXCEPTION...END` block.
    - **Clean Up Code:**  The commented-out `RAISE_ERROR` should be removed or implemented properly.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals (Improved Readability):**  Merge the `NEW_GEMINIA` version after adding comprehensive exception handling and testing.

- **If the Change Does Not Align (Unintended Changes):** Investigate the reason for the changes and revert to the `HERITAGE` version if necessary.

- **If Uncertain:**  Conduct a thorough code review with stakeholders to clarify the intent and ensure the changes are appropriate.


## Additional Considerations

- **Database Integrity:** The changes are unlikely to affect database integrity as they only involve string manipulation.

- **Performance Impact:** The performance impact is expected to be negligible.

- **Error Messages:** The lack of error handling is a significant concern.  The merged version should include informative error messages to aid debugging and troubleshooting.


## Conclusion

The changes between the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` versions of `merge_claims_text` are primarily cosmetic improvements in formatting and indentation.  The most critical issue is the absence of exception handling.  The recommended approach is to merge the improved formatting from the `NEW_GEMINIA` version, but crucially, add robust exception handling and thorough testing before deploying the updated function to production.  This will ensure both code readability and reliability.
