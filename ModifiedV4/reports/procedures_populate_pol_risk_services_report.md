# PL/SQL Procedure `populate_pol_risk_services` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `populate_pol_risk_services` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

- **HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic (`IF v_endors_no = NULL THEN ... END IF;`) for handling null `v_endors_no` values was placed before the `SELECT COUNT(*)` statement.  This means the query to fetch `pol_ren_endos_no` was always executed, regardless of whether `v_endors_no` was actually null.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The conditional logic is now correctly positioned. The `SELECT COUNT(*)` statement is executed first. The query to fetch `pol_ren_endos_no` is only executed if `v_endors_no` is NULL, improving efficiency.


### Modification of WHERE Clauses

- **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed or added within the `WHERE` clauses of the `SELECT` and `DELETE` statements.  The structure remains consistent.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

- **HERITAGE Version:** Exception handling was less structured.  A single `WHEN OTHERS` block handled exceptions for both the `SELECT COUNT(*)` and `INSERT` statements.  Error messages were raised using a potentially undefined `raise_error` procedure.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:**  Exception handling is improved with separate `WHEN OTHERS` blocks for the `SELECT COUNT(*)` and `INSERT` statements, allowing for more granular error handling. The `raise_error` procedure is still used, but its definition should be verified.


### Formatting and Indentation

- The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, making the code more readable and maintainable.  Parameter lists are broken across multiple lines for better readability.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

- **Priority Shift:** The HERITAGE version unnecessarily executed a database query even when the `v_endors_no` was not null. The NEW_GEMINIA version optimizes this by only executing the query when necessary.

- **Potential Outcome Difference:** The change in logic should not affect the final outcome of the procedure, provided the `raise_error` procedure functions correctly and handles errors appropriately. However, the improved efficiency in the NEW_GEMINIA version reduces unnecessary database load.


### Business Rule Alignment

The changes primarily impact the efficiency and robustness of the procedure. There is no apparent change to the underlying business rules regarding how policy risk services are populated.


### Impact on Clients

The changes are internal to the database procedure and should be transparent to clients.  Performance improvements might indirectly benefit clients through faster processing times.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

- **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the improved efficiency and structured exception handling in the NEW_GEMINIA version align with the overall project goals.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with relevant stakeholders (database administrators, business analysts) to ensure the modifications meet their expectations and do not introduce unintended consequences.

### Test Thoroughly

- **Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including null and non-null `v_endors_no` values, successful and unsuccessful insertions, and different error conditions.

- **Validate Outcomes:**  Compare the results of the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions to ensure data integrity and consistency.


### Merge Strategy

- **Conditional Merge:**  A direct merge is feasible after thorough testing.  Consider using a version control system to track changes and facilitate rollback if needed.

- **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  If backward compatibility is crucial, consider creating a new procedure with a different name for the NEW_GEMINIA version, allowing both versions to coexist temporarily.


### Update Documentation

Update the procedure's documentation to reflect the changes made, including the improved exception handling and the optimized conditional logic.


### Code Quality Improvements

- **Consistent Exception Handling:**  Replace the `raise_error` procedure with standard PL/SQL exception handling mechanisms (`DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE` or raising a custom exception) for better error management and consistency.

- **Clean Up Code:**  Further refine the code formatting and indentation for enhanced readability.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and documentation updates.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes and investigate the reasons for the discrepancy between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

- **If Uncertain:** Conduct further analysis and testing to clarify the impact of the changes before deciding on a merge strategy.


## Additional Considerations

- **Database Integrity:**  Thorough testing is crucial to ensure the changes do not compromise database integrity.

- **Performance Impact:**  Monitor the performance of the NEW_GEMINIA version to confirm the expected efficiency gains.

- **Error Messages:**  Improve error messages to provide more context and facilitate debugging.


## Conclusion

The changes in the `populate_pol_risk_services` procedure primarily focus on improving efficiency and code quality.  The reordering of conditional logic enhances performance, while the improved exception handling increases robustness.  A thorough testing phase is crucial before merging the NEW_GEMINIA version to ensure data integrity and alignment with business requirements.  Addressing the `raise_error` procedure and further refining code formatting will enhance maintainability and readability.
