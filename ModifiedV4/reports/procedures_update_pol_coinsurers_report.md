# PL/SQL Procedure `update_pol_coinsurers` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `update_pol_coinsurers` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

- **HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic primarily focused on whether a policy was a leader (v_leader = 'Y') and then proceeded to handle updates based on that.  The check for existing coinsurers was nested within the leader check.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The conditional logic is restructured. It first checks if a leader is being set (v_leader = 'Y'). If not, it checks for the existence of multiple coinsurance leaders, raising an error if more than one exists. This improves clarity and error handling.


### Modification of WHERE Clauses

- **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** The `WHERE` clause in the `UPDATE` statement for `gin_coinsurers` has been significantly extended in the NEW_GEMINIA version.  It now includes conditions for `coin_comm_rate`, `coin_comm_type`, `COIN_FAC_CESSION`, and `COIN_FAC_PC`, reflecting the addition of these parameters to the procedure.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

- **HERITAGE Version:** Exception handling was somewhat rudimentary, using a generic `WHEN OTHERS` clause with a single error message for multiple potential issues.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** Exception handling is improved with more specific error messages for different potential exceptions, providing better diagnostic information.  The `raise_error` function is used consistently.

### Formatting and Indentation

- The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, enhancing readability and maintainability.  Parameter names are more consistently formatted.  The addition of comments also improves understanding.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

- **Priority Shift:**  The HERITAGE version implicitly prioritized leader updates. The NEW_GEMINIA version explicitly handles leader updates and adds checks to prevent multiple leaders.  The addition of `v_comm_rate`, `v_comm_type`, `v_COIN_FAC_CESSION`, and `v_COIN_FAC_PC` introduces new parameters influencing fee calculation.

- **Potential Outcome Difference:** The changes in conditional logic and the addition of new parameters could lead to different outcomes in fee calculations, especially if multiple coinsurers exist.  The addition of the check for more than one leader in the non-leader case is a significant change in business logic.

### Business Rule Alignment

The NEW_GEMINIA version appears to enforce a stricter business rule regarding the number of coinsurance leaders allowed per transaction (only one).  This was implicitly handled in the HERITAGE version but is now explicitly enforced.  The addition of new parameters suggests an extension of the business rules related to commission calculations.

### Impact on Clients

The changes could impact clients if the fee calculations differ significantly between the two versions.  The stricter enforcement of the single-leader rule might also affect clients who previously had multiple leaders on a transaction.  Thorough testing is crucial to understand the full impact.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

- **Confirm Intent:**  Verify that the changes in logic and the addition of new parameters (`v_comm_type`, `v_COIN_FAC_CESSION`, `v_COIN_FAC_PC`) align with the current business requirements.  Confirm the intent behind the stricter enforcement of a single coinsurance leader per transaction.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with business stakeholders, including those responsible for defining and maintaining the business rules, to ensure the NEW_GEMINIA version accurately reflects the intended functionality.

### Test Thoroughly

- **Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including edge cases (e.g., multiple coinsurers, leader and non-leader scenarios, different values for new parameters).  Pay close attention to the scenarios where the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions might produce different results.

- **Validate Outcomes:**  Carefully compare the results of the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions for each test case to identify any discrepancies and ensure the NEW_GEMINIA version behaves as expected.

### Merge Strategy

- **Conditional Merge:**  A conditional merge approach might be beneficial.  This would involve carefully reviewing each change and deciding whether to incorporate it based on the business requirements and testing results.

- **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  If possible, consider maintaining backward compatibility by adding a parameter to control the behavior (e.g., a flag to switch between HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA logic).  This would allow for a phased rollout and minimize disruption.

### Update Documentation

Thoroughly update the procedure's documentation to reflect the changes in logic, parameters, and exception handling.

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Consistent Exception Handling:**  Maintain the improved exception handling in the NEW_GEMINIA version.

- **Clean Up Code:**  Ensure consistent formatting and indentation throughout the procedure.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:**  Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing and documentation updates.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:**  Revert the changes and investigate the reasons for the discrepancy between the intended functionality and the implemented changes.

- **If Uncertain:**  Conduct further investigation and consultation with stakeholders to clarify the requirements and ensure the correct implementation.


## Additional Considerations

- **Database Integrity:**  Ensure the changes do not compromise database integrity.  Pay close attention to the potential impact on existing data.

- **Performance Impact:**  Assess the performance impact of the changes, especially the addition of new conditions in the `WHERE` clause.  Consider adding indexes if necessary.

- **Error Messages:**  The improved error messages in the NEW_GEMINIA version are a significant improvement.  Ensure that all error messages are informative and helpful for debugging.


## Conclusion

The changes in `update_pol_coinsurers` represent a significant update to the procedure's logic and functionality.  The improved exception handling and formatting are positive changes.  However, the alterations to the conditional logic and the addition of new parameters require careful review, thorough testing, and consultation with stakeholders to ensure the changes align with business requirements and do not introduce unintended consequences.  A phased rollout with backward compatibility might be a prudent approach to minimize disruption.
