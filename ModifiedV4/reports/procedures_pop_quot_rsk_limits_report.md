# PL/SQL Procedure `pop_quot_rsk_limits` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `pop_quot_rsk_limits` between the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` versions.


## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

- **HERITAGE Version:** The `HERITAGE` version uses a cursor to fetch data and iteratively inserts records into `gin_quot_risk_limits`.  Conditional logic within the loop handles potential errors during insertion.  A final check verifies if any records were inserted, raising an exception if no mandatory sections were found.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The `NEW_GEMINIA` version completely removes the cursor loop and direct insertion logic. Instead, it calls another procedure, `update_mandatory_sections`, to handle the population of `gin_quot_risk_limits`.  The conditional logic for handling missing mandatory sections is likely encapsulated within `update_mandatory_sections`.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

- **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** The `HERITAGE` version's cursor uses a complex `WHERE` clause to select sections based on several conditions, including mandatory sections (`NVL(scvts_mandatory,'N')='Y'`) and those not already present in `gin_quot_risk_limits`. The `NEW_GEMINIA` version removes this complex `WHERE` clause, delegating the filtering logic to the `update_mandatory_sections` procedure.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

- **HERITAGE Version:** The `HERITAGE` version includes a nested `BEGIN...EXCEPTION...END` block within the loop to handle potential errors during the insertion of individual records. A separate exception is raised if no records are inserted.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The `NEW_GEMINIA` version does not explicitly handle exceptions within the procedure itself. Exception handling is presumably handled within the called procedure `update_mandatory_sections`.

### Formatting and Indentation

- The `NEW_GEMINIA` version shows improved formatting and indentation compared to the `HERITAGE` version.  The code is more concise and readable.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

- **Priority Shift:** The `HERITAGE` version directly calculates and inserts fee-related data (premium rates, minimum amounts, etc.) based on the fetched section data. The `NEW_GEMINIA` version abstracts this logic, potentially changing the order or method of calculation within the `update_mandatory_sections` procedure.

- **Potential Outcome Difference:**  There's a potential for subtle differences in fee calculations if the internal logic of `update_mandatory_sections` differs from the explicit calculations in the `HERITAGE` version.  This could lead to discrepancies in the final premium amounts.

### Business Rule Alignment

The changes might reflect a shift in how business rules regarding mandatory sections and premium calculations are implemented. The `NEW_GEMINIA` version suggests a more modular and potentially more maintainable approach. However, without knowing the implementation of `update_mandatory_sections`, it's difficult to definitively assess the alignment.

### Impact on Clients

The changes could impact clients if the fee calculations differ between versions. This could lead to unexpected changes in quoted premiums.  Thorough testing is crucial to mitigate this risk.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

- **Confirm Intent:**  Verify if the changes in logic and the introduction of `update_mandatory_sections` are intentional and align with the current business requirements.  Document the rationale behind the changes.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with business analysts and stakeholders to ensure the new logic accurately reflects the intended business rules and to understand the implications of the changes.

### Test Thoroughly

- **Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions, to validate the accuracy of premium calculations in both versions.  Pay close attention to scenarios involving mandatory and non-mandatory sections.

- **Validate Outcomes:** Compare the results of the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` versions for a large representative sample of data to identify any discrepancies.

### Merge Strategy

- **Conditional Merge:**  A conditional merge might be necessary, potentially using a flag or configuration parameter to switch between the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` logic during a transition period. This allows for a phased rollout and minimizes disruption.

- **Maintain Backward Compatibility:** Ensure backward compatibility during the transition period to avoid impacting existing clients.

### Update Documentation

Update the package documentation to reflect the changes made, including a description of the `update_mandatory_sections` procedure and its functionality.

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Consistent Exception Handling:**  Standardize exception handling across the package.  If `update_mandatory_sections` handles exceptions appropriately, this is a positive change.  If not, address this in the updated procedure.

- **Clean Up Code:** Refactor the `HERITAGE` version to improve readability and maintainability before merging, if necessary.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Proceed with the merge after thorough testing and documentation updates.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes and investigate the reasons for the discrepancy between the intended business rules and the implemented logic.

- **If Uncertain:** Conduct further investigation to clarify the intent of the changes and their impact on the system.


## Additional Considerations

- **Database Integrity:** Ensure the changes do not compromise database integrity.  Validate that the `update_mandatory_sections` procedure maintains referential integrity and data consistency.

- **Performance Impact:**  Assess the performance impact of the changes.  The `NEW_GEMINIA` version might be more efficient if `update_mandatory_sections` is optimized.  Benchmark both versions to compare performance.

- **Error Messages:**  Review and improve error messages to provide more informative feedback to users and developers.


## Conclusion

The changes to `pop_quot_rsk_limits` represent a significant restructuring of the procedure's logic. While the `NEW_GEMINIA` version appears more modular and potentially more maintainable, thorough testing and validation are crucial to ensure the accuracy of fee calculations and to avoid unintended consequences for clients.  A phased rollout with backward compatibility is recommended to minimize disruption during the transition.  A careful review of the `update_mandatory_sections` procedure is essential to fully understand the implications of these changes.
