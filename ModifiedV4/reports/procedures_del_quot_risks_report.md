# PL/SQL Procedure `del_quot_risks` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the `del_quot_risks` procedure between the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

* **HERITAGE Version:** The `HERITAGE` version implicitly implies a sequential deletion.  It deletes from `gin_quot_risk_excess`, then `gin_quot_risk_clauses`, then `gin_quot_risk_limits`, and finally `gin_quot_risks`.  The order suggests a dependency where child records must be deleted before parent records.

* **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The `NEW_GEMINIA` version maintains the same sequential deletion logic but with improved formatting. The order of deletions remains the same, implying the same dependency as the HERITAGE version.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

* **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed or added. The `WHERE` clauses in both versions remain identical, filtering deletions based on the input parameter `v_qr_code`.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

* **HERITAGE Version:** The `HERITAGE` version lacks explicit exception handling. Any errors during the deletion process would propagate without specific handling.

* **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The `NEW_GEMINIA` version also lacks explicit exception handling.  This is a significant concern and needs to be addressed.

### Formatting and Indentation

* The `NEW_GEMINIA` version shows improved formatting and indentation, enhancing readability and maintainability.  The code is more concise and easier to understand.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

* **Priority Shift:** There is no apparent change in the logic of fee determination within this procedure.  The procedure only deletes records; it doesn't calculate fees.

* **Potential Outcome Difference:** The reordering of the `DELETE` statements, while seemingly minor, could have implications if referential integrity constraints are not properly defined.  If a constraint violation occurs during deletion, the process could fail.  The order of deletion is crucial to ensure data consistency.

### Business Rule Alignment

The changes do not appear to alter core business rules. The procedure's functionality remains the same: deleting records associated with a given quote risk code. However, the lack of exception handling could lead to unexpected behavior and data inconsistencies if errors occur during deletion.

### Impact on Clients

The changes are primarily internal and should not directly impact clients. However, if the deletions fail due to unhandled exceptions or data inconsistencies, it could indirectly affect clients by preventing accurate reporting or data processing.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

* **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the improved formatting and the implicit order of deletions are intentional and align with the business requirements.  The lack of exception handling must be addressed.

### Consult Stakeholders

Discuss the changes with database administrators and business users to ensure the updated procedure meets expectations and handles potential errors gracefully.

### Test Thoroughly

* **Create Test Cases:** Develop comprehensive test cases to cover various scenarios, including successful deletions, deletions with potential constraint violations, and error handling.

* **Validate Outcomes:**  Verify that data integrity is maintained after the deletions and that the procedure handles errors appropriately.

### Merge Strategy

* **Conditional Merge:** Merge the `NEW_GEMINIA` version due to its improved formatting. However, the lack of exception handling is a critical issue that needs to be addressed before merging.

* **Maintain Backward Compatibility:** Ensure the updated procedure behaves identically to the `HERITAGE` version in terms of functionality, except for improved error handling.

### Update Documentation

Update the procedure's documentation to reflect the changes, including the improved formatting and the addition of robust exception handling.

### Code Quality Improvements

* **Consistent Exception Handling:** Implement comprehensive exception handling to catch and handle potential errors (e.g., `ORA-02292` integrity constraint violation).  Log errors appropriately and potentially provide informative error messages to the calling procedure.

* **Clean Up Code:** Maintain the improved formatting and indentation from the `NEW_GEMINIA` version.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

* **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the improved version after adding comprehensive exception handling and thorough testing.

* **If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes and investigate the reasons for the discrepancy between the versions.

* **If Uncertain:** Conduct further analysis and consult stakeholders before making a decision.


## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

The order of deletions is critical for maintaining database integrity.  Ensure that referential integrity constraints are correctly defined and enforced to prevent errors.

### Performance Impact

The changes are unlikely to significantly impact performance, but thorough testing should be performed to confirm this.

### Error Messages

Implement informative error messages to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.


## Conclusion

The changes to the `del_quot_risks` procedure primarily involve improved formatting and implicitly defined deletion order.  However, the critical omission of exception handling necessitates immediate attention.  Before merging, robust exception handling must be implemented, and thorough testing must be conducted to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected behavior.  The improved formatting should be retained.  The final merged version should be thoroughly documented.
