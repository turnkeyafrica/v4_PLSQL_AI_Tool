# PL/SQL Procedure `update_docs_reqrd` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `update_docs_reqrd` between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions.

## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

- **HERITAGE Version:** The `WHERE` clause in the cursor `v_docr` had conditions stacked vertically, potentially impacting readability.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The `WHERE` clause conditions are now formatted with indentation, improving readability and maintainability.  The logic itself remains unchanged.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

- **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed or added. The logic within the `WHERE` clause remains identical.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

- **HERITAGE Version:** No explicit exception handling is present.  The procedure relies on implicit exception handling.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** No explicit exception handling is added.  The procedure still relies on implicit exception handling.  This remains a significant risk.

### Formatting and Indentation

- The NEW_GEMINIA version shows improved formatting and indentation, enhancing readability and maintainability.  Parameter lists are broken across multiple lines for improved readability.  The `INSERT` statement is also formatted across multiple lines to improve readability.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

- **Priority Shift:** The core logic of selecting documents remains unchanged.  There is no fee determination logic present in this procedure.

- **Potential Outcome Difference:** No change in the outcome is expected as the core logic remains the same.

### Business Rule Alignment

The changes do not appear to alter any underlying business rules. The procedure continues to identify mandatory documents based on `docr_mandtry`, `docr_level`, and `docr_clp_code`, and inserts records into `gin_uw_doc_reqrd_submtd` if they haven't already been submitted.

### Impact on Clients

The changes are purely internal to the database procedure and should have no direct impact on clients.

## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

- **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the formatting changes align with coding standards and that no unintended logic changes were introduced.

### Consult Stakeholders

Consult with developers and business analysts to confirm the intent behind the formatting changes and to ensure that no functional changes were inadvertently introduced.

### Test Thoroughly

- **Create Test Cases:** Create comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including different document levels, client codes, and existing submitted documents.  Pay particular attention to edge cases and boundary conditions.

- **Validate Outcomes:** Verify that the procedure functions identically in both versions, producing the same output for the same input.

### Merge Strategy

- **Conditional Merge:** A simple merge should suffice, as the changes are primarily formatting and indentation improvements.

- **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**  Backward compatibility is maintained as the core functionality remains unchanged.

### Update Documentation

Update the procedure's documentation to reflect the formatting changes and any clarifications resulting from the review process.

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Consistent Exception Handling:**  Add explicit exception handling to gracefully handle potential errors (e.g., `DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX`, `NO_DATA_FOUND`).  This is crucial for robustness.

- **Clean Up Code:**  While the formatting is improved, consider further improvements such as using more descriptive variable names if appropriate.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals:** Merge the NEW_GEMINIA version after thorough testing.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:** Revert the changes and investigate the reason for the discrepancy.

- **If Uncertain:** Conduct further analysis and testing to clarify the impact of the changes before merging.


## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

The changes should not impact database integrity, assuming the underlying data model and constraints remain unchanged.

### Performance Impact

The formatting changes are unlikely to have a significant impact on performance.

### Error Messages

The lack of explicit exception handling is a major concern.  Improved error handling should provide more informative messages to aid debugging and troubleshooting.


## Conclusion

The changes between the HERITAGE and NEW_GEMINIA versions of `update_docs_reqrd` are primarily cosmetic, focusing on improved formatting and readability.  However, the lack of exception handling in both versions is a significant risk that needs to be addressed.  Before merging, thorough testing and a review of the business requirements are crucial to ensure that no unintended consequences are introduced.  The primary recommendation is to merge the improved formatting, but *immediately* add robust exception handling.
