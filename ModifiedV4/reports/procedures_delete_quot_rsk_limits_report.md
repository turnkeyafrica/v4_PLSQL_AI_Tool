# PL/SQL Procedure `delete_quot_rsk_limits` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the PL/SQL procedure `delete_quot_rsk_limits` between the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` versions.


## Summary of Key Changes

### Reordering of Conditional Logic

- **HERITAGE Version:** The `WHERE` clause conditions were spread across multiple lines, potentially impacting readability.  The logic itself was functionally equivalent to the new version.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The `WHERE` clause conditions are now on a single line, improving readability and maintainability.  This is purely a formatting change and does not affect the procedure's functionality.

### Modification of WHERE Clauses

- **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No conditions were removed or added. The logic remains identical in both versions.  The only change is formatting.

### Exception Handling Adjustments

- **HERITAGE Version:** No explicit exception handling was present.  This is a potential risk.

- **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** No explicit exception handling was added. The lack of exception handling remains a concern.

### Formatting and Indentation

- The `NEW_GEMINIA` version shows improved formatting and indentation. The procedure declaration is more concise, and the `WHERE` clause is more compact. This enhances readability and code clarity.


## Implications of the Changes

### Logic Alteration in Fee Determination

- **Priority Shift:** There is no change to the core deletion logic. The `WHERE` clause remains identical in both versions.

- **Potential Outcome Difference:** No functional difference is expected. The changes are purely stylistic.

### Business Rule Alignment

The changes do not affect the underlying business rules. The procedure continues to delete records based on `qrl_qr_code` and `qrl_sect_type`.

### Impact on Clients

The changes are purely internal and should have no impact on clients.


## Recommendations for Merging

### Review Business Requirements

- **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the sole intent was to improve code formatting and readability.  The lack of exception handling should be addressed.

### Consult Stakeholders

Consult with developers and business analysts to confirm the changes are acceptable and do not introduce unintended consequences.

### Test Thoroughly

- **Create Test Cases:** Create comprehensive test cases to cover various scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions.  These tests should verify that the number of deleted rows is correct.

- **Validate Outcomes:**  Validate that the number of rows deleted matches expectations in both versions.

### Merge Strategy

- **Conditional Merge:** A simple merge is acceptable, given the changes are primarily stylistic.

- **Maintain Backward Compatibility:** Backward compatibility is maintained as the functionality remains unchanged.

### Update Documentation

Update the procedure's documentation to reflect the formatting changes.

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Consistent Exception Handling:**  Implement robust exception handling to catch potential errors (e.g., `ORA-00001: unique constraint violated`).  This is crucial for production code.

- **Clean Up Code:**  While the formatting is improved, consider adding comments to explain the purpose of the procedure and the meaning of the `qrl_sect_type` values.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals (which it does regarding formatting):** Merge the `NEW_GEMINIA` version after implementing the recommended exception handling and adding comments.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:** This scenario is unlikely given the nature of the changes.  However, if there are concerns, revert to the `HERITAGE` version and address the formatting issues separately.

- **If Uncertain:** Conduct thorough testing and consult stakeholders before merging.


## Additional Considerations

### Database Integrity

The changes do not pose a direct threat to database integrity, provided the `WHERE` clause correctly identifies the rows to be deleted.

### Performance Impact

The performance impact is expected to be negligible.

### Error Messages

The lack of exception handling is a significant concern.  Appropriate error handling should be added to provide informative error messages to the user in case of failures.


## Conclusion

The changes to the `delete_quot_rsk_limits` procedure are primarily stylistic improvements in formatting and indentation.  While the functional logic remains the same, the lack of exception handling is a critical issue that needs immediate attention.  The `NEW_GEMINIA` version should be merged after addressing this deficiency and adding comprehensive error handling and comments.  Thorough testing is essential to ensure the procedure functions correctly and reliably.
