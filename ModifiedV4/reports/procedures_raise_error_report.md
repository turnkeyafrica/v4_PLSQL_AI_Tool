# PL/SQL Procedure `raise_error` Change Analysis Report

This report analyzes the changes made to the `raise_error` procedure between the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` versions.  The changes are minimal but warrant careful consideration.

## Summary of Key Changes

The diff shows only minor formatting changes.  There are no functional changes to the logic of the procedure itself.

- **Reordering of Conditional Logic:**
    - **HERITAGE Version:** The conditional logic (`IF SQLCODE != 0 THEN ... ELSE ... END IF;`) is presented with less consistent indentation.
    - **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** The indentation is slightly improved for better readability, but the core logic remains identical.

- **Modification of WHERE Clauses:**
    - **Removal and Addition of Conditions:** No changes to WHERE clauses exist as this procedure does not contain any SQL queries.

- **Exception Handling Adjustments:**
    - **HERITAGE Version:** Uses `raise_application_error` with error code -20015, concatenating the input message with `SQLERRM` if `SQLCODE` is not 0.
    - **NEW_GEMINIA Version:** Identical exception handling mechanism.

- **Formatting and Indentation:**
    - The `NEW_GEMINIA` version exhibits slightly improved indentation, enhancing readability.  This is a purely cosmetic change.


## Implications of the Changes

- **Logic Alteration in Fee Determination:**
    - **Priority Shift:**  The procedure does not involve fee determination; therefore, this section is not applicable.
    - **Potential Outcome Difference:** No change in outcome is expected as the core logic remains unchanged.

- **Business Rule Alignment:**
    - The changes do not impact any business rules.

- **Impact on Clients:**
    - No impact on clients is anticipated as the functionality remains the same.


## Recommendations for Merging

- **Review Business Requirements:**
    - **Confirm Intent:** Verify that the sole intent of the change was to improve code readability through improved formatting.

- **Consult Stakeholders:**
    -  While not strictly necessary for such a minor change, a brief communication to the development team confirming the intent would be beneficial.

- **Test Thoroughly:**
    - **Create Test Cases:**  While minimal testing is needed, create a few test cases to confirm the error handling still functions correctly.  Test cases should cover scenarios where `SQLCODE` is 0 and non-0.
    - **Validate Outcomes:** Verify that error messages are generated and displayed as expected in both scenarios.

- **Merge Strategy:**
    - **Conditional Merge:** A simple merge is sufficient.  The changes are purely cosmetic and do not affect the procedure's behavior.
    - **Maintain Backward Compatibility:** Backward compatibility is inherently maintained as the functionality is unchanged.

- **Update Documentation:**
    - No documentation update is required as the functionality remains the same.

- **Code Quality Improvements:**
    - **Consistent Exception Handling:** The exception handling is already consistent.
    - **Clean Up Code:** The improved indentation is a positive step towards cleaner code.


## Potential Actions Based on Analysis

- **If the Change Aligns with Business Goals (which it does, assuming the goal is improved readability):** Merge the changes directly.

- **If the Change Does Not Align:** This scenario is unlikely given the nature of the changes.  If there's a reason to believe the formatting change is undesirable, revert to the heritage version.

- **If Uncertain:**  Consult with the development team to clarify the intent behind the change.


## Additional Considerations

- **Database Integrity:** The changes pose no threat to database integrity.

- **Performance Impact:** The performance impact is negligible.

- **Error Messages:** The error messages remain unchanged and should continue to function as expected.


## Conclusion

The changes between the `HERITAGE` and `NEW_GEMINIA` versions of the `raise_error` procedure are minimal and primarily cosmetic.  The improved indentation enhances readability without altering the procedure's functionality.  A straightforward merge is recommended after a brief review and minimal testing to confirm the error handling remains correct.
